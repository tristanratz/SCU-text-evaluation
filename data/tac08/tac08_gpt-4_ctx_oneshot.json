Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.    Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.    The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.    In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.

The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. 33 were injured in an emergency evacuation drill. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. Airbus plans to deliver the first two jets to Singapore Airlines by the end of 2006.    By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. The first A380 delivery (to Singapore) slid from early to late 2006. With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries.

Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.    Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.    In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.    The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate.

Worldwide, countries are agreeing that the U.N. Kyoto Protocol, which commits 39 nations to reduce greenhouse gases, is not enough. Infrastructure in Russia is being damaged due to the melting permafrost including airports, gas pipelines and railways. Wildlife including polar bears, reindeer, seals, and fish are threatened as well as many plant species. Fishing zones are disappearing. Shipping lanes are at risk. The Arctic and Antarctic of today will be radically changed within the next century if action is not taken worldwide.    Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears. Less ice reflects less sunlight, warming the planet, leading to more ice melt and sea-level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100. Greenland's ice fishing season has shortened. Lake areas doubled. Glaciers Sermeg, Sermilik, and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster. Alaska's Columbia glacier also melted faster.    Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. If this occurs, considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere, which could amplify global warming. However, another researcher disagrees that the thaw would be so large. He states that Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.     Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change. There continues to be disagreement on whether or not this is the effect of human activity, although scientists agree that something has changed radically and that there are few other explanations. New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply.

The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.

The Medicare website has been so inundated with traffic that it is extremely slow or jammed thus adding to the frustration and anger of enrollees seeking information independently.

Computer savvy children of seniors are just as confused and baffled over plan details as their parents.    Calls for help have increased sharply since enrollment for Medicare Part D opened. Many organizations and volunteers try to supplement the swamped Medicare lines, but all face developing backlogs and problems training personnel. The multiplicity of options, deductibles, premiums and exceptions make comparisons overwhelming if not impossible. Some lawmakers are suggesting a two-year delay in implementation of the plan. One week into open application, The New York Times declared Part D as an attempt to do something about drug costs for seniors and at the same time protect drug and insurance companies. &quot;It's a mess. It's hopelessly confusing.&quot;    Seniors are daunted by comparing their current coverage with Part D, baffled by hundreds of complex options, and fearful of picking the wrong Part D plan with wide-ranging premiums and unpredictable coverage changes, potentially costing them several thousands of dollars more annually. Only 6% of Medicare beneficiaries visited the balky web-based Part D plan selection tool. Many drug companies will stop offering free or subsidized promotional drugs to needy seniors. Increased competition among Part D private providers lowered some premiums, but a Senate report showed Part D drug prices are 3% higher than CostCo and Drugstore.com; 60% higher than Canada.    The Plan D's intricacies and implementation have been so criticized that some lawmakers a pushing for a two-year delay. Various consumer advocacy groups will assist Medicare enrollees in understanding Plan D. A Medicare spokesman said that the agency updated the plans and prices every Monday and that an enrollee could change plans every day until the end of 2005. When the program starts on January 1st, the enrollee will be paying the rate quoted at enrollment time. Plan D got off to a rocky start with the beginning of enrollment on November 15, because of the complexity of the system.

The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.      Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.    Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed &quot;Terri's law&quot; through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.    The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President.

Judge Greer issued an injunction keeping the DCF and police away from Terri. Courts consistently rejected appeals related to abuse allegations or new medical diagnoses, and efforts to block Terri's cremation. The US Supreme Court again declined involvement. A federal appeals court agreed to consider a new hearing but Terri died first.    Terri Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March, thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed by court order.

Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt. There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.      Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.    The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of &quot;planet.&quot; Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight &quot;inner&quot; planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.     Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. &quot;Planet&quot; has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.

Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects. However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument. Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue. The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces. Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313. The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.    A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena). Both might be called &quot;minor planets&quot; or could be considered KBOs. NASA's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto's claim to planethood by finding its second and perhaps third moon. On Jan 20, 2006 NASA launched its New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt which it is scheduled to reach in July 2015. Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto's 1380. The IAU committee continues to deliberate.    Debate continues over what constitutes a planet. Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers (both Pluto and UB313 do). Another suggestion is roundness: this would include these two and likely several others yet unknown. Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate its surroundings, which would exclude Pluto and UB313. Pluto became more interesting when the Hubble telescope discoverd that Pluto had not just one but three moons. Scientific interest in Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission: a nine year trip to Pluto and beyond.     Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term. KBO 2003 UB313, discovered by Michael E. Brown, was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto. Both have surface methane ice. If Pluto is a planet, 2003 UB313 should be too. The Hubble Space Telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto, 30-100 miles in diameter. Pluto and its large moon Charon, close physically and in size, may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between them. At least four KBOs have known moons.

The lawsuit was dismissed on June 6 for lack of evidence and Rossi did not appeal to the Supreme Court.    Christine Gregoire's inauguration as Washington's governor occurred amid a legal challenge by Republican candidate Rossi. Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that his court rather than the state legislature would investigate the election. The judge ruled that before ordering a new election or declaring Rossi the winner, Republicans would need to prove Rossi received more votes than Gregoire after supposed illegal votes were deducted. Bridges noted that the only proven illegal votes had been for Rossi. Five months after the inauguration, Judge Bridges dismissed the Republican lawsuit. After that ruling, Rossi ended his legal effort to remove Gregoire.    Gregoire was sworn in as governor and proceeded to govern as if elected by landslide, imposing taxes and improving roads. Rossi sued for a revote in Republican-leaning, rural Chelan County, claiming illegal votes by felons and ballot-box stuffing. Most Washingtonians opposed a revote.

On Aug. 4, 2005 the Russian navy, working desperately to disengage a small military submarine with seven crew snagged by underwater cables at a depth of 625 feet off the Kamchatka peninsula, called for international help. Japan dispatched four vessels, Britain's Royal Navy sent a submersible Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and the U. S. Pacific fleet sent two vehicles similar to the British. Estimates varied as to how much oxygen remained for the entrapped crewmen. The British vehicle arrived first and on Aug. 7 the submarine was cut loose and the crewmen were found all alive.    For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay. The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system. Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply. When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help. Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts. A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub. All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.    A small Russian submarine with seven crew members was trapped on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula late on 4 August. The Russians tried desperately to pull the sub to shallower waters but those efforts failed. They sought international assistance. Japan sent four naval vessels, the U.S. sent three underwater vehicles, but the British were the first to arrive, with remote control submersibles. They cut away the net or undersea cables trapping the sub, enabling it to rise to the surface after almost three days at the bottom. All seven crew members were alive and well.

Updated equipment was soon purchased. President Putin ordered an investigation of the accident. On Sept. 4 Putin fired the head of the navy. On Sept 6 the defense minister announced that the submarine accident was a result of outrageous violations of the instructions by senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet and that the crew had made errors.    An investigation uncovered violations of instructions and errors in operating the mini-sub that contributed to the recent accident. Prosecutors accused a naval officer of negligence for damaging Russia's own Venom rescue vehicle, thereby necessitating international assistance. Newspapers criticized the navy for waiting over a day before revealing information about the accident. There are conflicting reports about whether the sub was caught in cables or fishing nets. The Russian navy is considering buying at least one Scorpio and possibly a newer model Panther rescue vehicle. The head of the Russian navy was fired, probably in part because of the accident.    Putin ordered the Defense Minister to launch an investigation. The head of the Navy was fired. A Navy captain was accused of damaging a Russian under-water remote-controlled vehicle in rescue attempts. Five British, one Japanese, and two Americans were given state awards.

Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.    In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections.

Exercise increases breast cancer survival 50%. Low melatonin levels in night-time workers increased breast cancer. Benign &quot;proliferative&quot; lesions correlate with later breast cancer. At 65 and older, early smaller localized tumors accounted for 96% of survival improvement; 38% under 50.    The drug Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients. Scientists reported that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat might reduce the chance that their tumors will return. A study showed that walking for three to five hours per week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent. Another study examining the role of childhood diet plays in breast cancer found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.    Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2. A low-fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence. Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades, can be mistaken as benign, and can take 40 years to develop. Night shift workers, women with benign breast lesions, and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer.     Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized. There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer.

Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena. The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.    Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.    After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient. Baseball executives and players union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for the current season.    Major League Baseball players Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco admitted taking steroids.

Judging cell-phone law results are difficult due to the lack of clear evidence in accidents except from witnesses or driver admissions. Driver education is a large part of cell-phone law enforcement. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey prompted the Department of Defense to restrict driver cell-phone use on military facilities. Enforcement policies vary by military base.      In 2005, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones while driving. Bills were passed or are still being considered in 22 states. The National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to restrict young drivers because teens account for a large share of traffic fatalities and cell phone use increases the problem. However, enforcing laws for young drivers is difficult. Both the U.S. Virgin Islands and Lackland Air Force Base have cell phone laws in place.    Every state has considered legislation on cell phones behind the wheel but only a few have banned them unless they are hands-free. Connecticut and Chicago have joined New York, New Jersey and DC in prohibiting use of hand-held phones. Many states have put limits on teens using cell phones while they drive. Enforcement of laws banning cell phone use while driving is a problem. Nearly everyone supports the laws, nearly everyone ignores them. The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use by motorists but left it for the military services and individual bases to decide how to enforce it.    The US Virgin Islands now bans hand-held cell phone use while driving. Eleven states including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland and Tennessee ban cell phone use by young drivers. California prohibits phone use while driving by bus drivers but not others. Under a Pentagon directive, bans on cell phone use while driving are becoming common on military bases. In 2005, 38 states tried to pass restrictive legislation. Effectiveness is difficult to assess because drivers or witnesses must confirm cell phone use coincided with accidents. Enforcement is difficult because officers can't easily ascertain drivers' ages or if they are using hands-free phones.

The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.    Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.    After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea.

Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.    Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.     Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.    Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent.

Improvements in grid architectures will increase network resilience. Deregulation resulted in lower margins for reserve power capacity and transmission capacity, as well as loss of experienced personnel. As companies specialized more in generation or transmission, supervisory data became proprietary and unavailable to regional grid managers. An August 2005 federal law will create a process for mandating reliability rules. Energy conservation and smart appliances that cut back during power grid stresses can avert blackouts.    The blackout in August 2003 that struck the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada was primarily caused by the deregulation of the utility companies. Experts said that changes in the industry had several adverse effects, including loss of experienced personnel and lawyers and MBAs now heading these competitive companies rather than engineers. Power plant capacity and its state of repair are proprietary now and not available to system operators who manage regional power grids. The energy law provides for mandatory reliability rules, but no power to enforce rules.    The factor widely considered behind the blackout of 2003 is the deregulation of the electric system. Under a regulated system, utilities could add transmission lines to increase reliability and their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process. Market participants prefer lower margins to drive up prices. A new energy bill now provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules. Some firms have identified advances in technology: cheap, powerful chips, more capable software and broadband communications that will impact on the energy business. Power saving devices and developing alternate power sources can contribute to the reliability of the power system.    California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 to deal with strains on the grid. In 2005 Los Angeles suffered three significant electrical failures, due to mistakes by workers or automatic systems. In 2005 the US and Canada discussed deregulation of the electric system, widely considered to be a cause of the 2003 blackout.

The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire &quot;inadequate,&quot; &quot;insufficient,&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;    President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.     President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.    President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; and asked her to redo it.

Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated. Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House, but the committee chair denied intruding on executive privilege. Democrats blamed the failure on right-wing ideologues. Sen. Lott (R-MS) blamed it on a nomination based on cronyism. On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned her conservative credentials, lack of judicial experience and criticized her for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House. Others said the White House bungled the nomination from the start. Many agreed that although she is a very capable person, President Bush shouldn't have chosen someone not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     President Bush announced that Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court. The announcement was met with a blend of regret, relief and a feeling that she had been treated poorly. Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents. Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling and the White House had capitulated to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Right Wing partisans expressed relief and some jubilation at her withdrawal.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court three and a half weeks after its initial announcement. Bush declared on 27 October that his choice had withdrawn her name and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her decision. She claimed that the fight over her nomination would be a burden for the White House. She also said that she wanted to protect the independence of the executive branch, citing the battle over access to her White House legal writings. She will continue to serve as White House counsel.

The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years. The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker. There have been 15 sightings captured on video although researchers can't determine how many were seen. The government proposed $10 million for efforts to protect the bird.

Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed.

The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp.

They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird. But they and others remained skeptical. In December over 100 researchers and volunteers began an intensive six-month search across 500,000 acres of Arkansas wetlands seeking definitive evidence of the bird. A local town benefited from bird watching tourists. In January 2006 Jackson published an article saying claims for proof of the bird's existence constitute &quot;faith-based ornithology&quot;.    Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker. The issue is whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker. Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence. A crew from Cornell Lab and its partner agencies will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search of 500,000 acres in the eastern Arkansas wetlands. An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker.    Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct. However, more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts. Cornell ornithologists made 17,000 hours of recordings near the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas. The discovery raised concerns that this habitat could be inundated with bird watchers. Cornell will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search for the bird. Federal authorities have provided $10.2M toward the effort and the Nature Conservancy has bought 18,000 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside for the bird.    The rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker was challenged in late April, almost three months after its announcement. Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient, a conclusion also reached by Sibley, author of well-known field guides. But two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge and the paper was not published.

After Akayev won overwhelming election victories the opposition charged the government with mass election violations, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and held a regional governor and a district chief hostage. Akayev ordered investigation and negotiations and fired the interior minister and prosecutor general while police dispersed crowds in Bishkek.    In February 2005 rallies in Bishkek urged President Akayev to step down as promised and constitutionally required after October presidential elections, fearing a referendum to continue his reign. Akayev supporters won a landslide parliamentary victory. Opposition leaders and the European Organization for Security and Cooperation charged the elections were flawed. By March 16 opposition forces rallied, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, demanded Akayev's resignation, and took hostage a regional governor and district chief.

Opposition against Akayev strengthened with international criticism for election abuses, his government's crackdown on opposition groups and independent media, and his failure to bring those responsible for killing six peaceful demonstrators in 2002 to justice. Poverty and widespread corruption contributed to public anger. Akayev fled to Russia after opposition supporters stormed the main government building and mobs looted parts of Bishkek.

In his address to the nation, Akayev apologized to people who bore him grudges, hoped the presidential election would be democratic, and said he wouldn't fight the new government.

Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.      A group of 169 Turkish intellectuals asked the government to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression and interfere with Turkey's democratic process. Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk stating that it wasn't legally competent to judge this case. The court was chided for framing the dismissal in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing freedom of expression. About 70 intellectuals have been charged as well, but they don't have the same high profile as Pamuk. The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases.    Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to rule on whether Pamuk should be tried, citing recent penal code amendments. It sent the case back to the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk. The case divided Turkey and embarrassed its liberals. Pamuk's remarks also highlighted another painful episode in Turkish history, the 30,000 Kurdish deaths in recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's Kurdish southeast. Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression. Potential EU partners wanted to know that Turkish laws were the same as laws elsewhere in the EU.    The case against Orhan Pamuk ended on 23 January. The Justice Ministry had refused to issue an approval of the prosecution and told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed. The Istanbul court dropped the charges. Pamuk's lawyer criticized the decision, saying that it was framed in bureaucratic terms and avoided the issue of freedom of expression. Turkish nationalists were outraged. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said that Pamuk was not the only one facing such charges, he was &quot;just the most high-profile case.&quot; PEN says that some 70 Turkish intellectuals have been charged with similar offenses.
