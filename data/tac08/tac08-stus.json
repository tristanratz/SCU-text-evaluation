        "summary": "The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.    Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.    The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.    In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.",

Airbus raised the price to approximately $292 million. A wing failure during testing may delay the A380's safety certification. The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. 33 were injured in an emergency evacuation drill. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. Airbus plans to deliver the first two jets to Singapore Airlines by the end of 2006.    By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. The first A380 delivery (to Singapore) slid from early to late 2006. With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries. By 2006 20 airports will be A380-ready; 38 by 2008; 60 by 2010.    The A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, an important component toward the super jumbo's official certification for commercial flights. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380. Production problems rather than safety or quality issues have caused the delays. Airbus has 159 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients. The US is studying the potential for turbulence generated by the A380 reflecting safety precautions.      In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. Customized cabins and entertainment system installation problems caused delays. France called unreasonable a US-proposed safety review to determine whether A380 turbulence would require greater distances around the plane. Airbus raised the A380's price by $10 million. A wing ruptured during a February 2006 stress test but the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification. Airbus was approaching its break-even point of 250 plane sales. Twenty airports would be ready for A380s in 2006, with Singapore Airlines being first to fly the plane.",

The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.    Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.    In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.    The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate.",

Kyoto Protocol, which commits 39 nations to reduce greenhouse gases, is not enough. Infrastructure in Russia is being damaged due to the melting permafrost including airports, gas pipelines and railways. Wildlife including polar bears, reindeer, seals, and fish are threatened as well as many plant species. Fishing zones are disappearing. Shipping lanes are at risk. The Arctic and Antarctic of today will be radically changed within the next century if action is not taken worldwide.    Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears. Less ice reflects less sunlight, warming the planet, leading to more ice melt and sea-level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100. Greenland's ice fishing season has shortened. Lake areas doubled. Glaciers Sermeg, Sermilik, and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster. Alaska's Columbia glacier also melted faster.    Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. If this occurs, considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere, which could amplify global warming. However, another researcher disagrees that the thaw would be so large. He states that Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.     Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change. There continues to be disagreement on whether or not this is the effect of human activity, although scientists agree that something has changed radically and that there are few other explanations. New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply. And two explorers working with Greenpeace could not complete a trip from Siberia to the North Pole because of the effects of rising temperatures, including broken ice, strong currents, and heavy rainfall.",

        "summary": "China sacrificed coal mine safety in its massive demand for energy. Gas explosions, flooding, fires, and cave-ins cause most accidents. The mining industry is riddled with corruption from mining officials to owners. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production. South Africa recently provided China with information on mining safety and technology during a conference. China is beginning enforcement of safety regulations. Over 12,000 mines have been ordered to suspend operations and 4,000 others ordered closed. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. China's mines are the most dangerous worldwide.    Chinese coalmines are said to be the most dangerous in the world.  January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004.  Accidents included explosions, floods and cave-ins.  The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.    China's accident-plagued coal mines cause thousands of deaths and injuries annually. 2004 saw over 6,000 mine deaths. January through August 2005, deaths rose 8.5% over the same period in 2004. Most accidents are gas explosions, but fires, floods, and cave-ins also occur. Ignored safety procedures, outdated equipment, and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem. Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill-managed and illegally-run mines, punishing errant owners, issuing new safety regulations and measures, and outlawing local officials from investing in mines. China also sought solutions at the Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held in Beijing.    China will close 8,648 coal mines during October 2005, for renewal of safety certificates in view of the large number of mine accidents causing loss of life. During the first nine months of the year, there were 2337 accidents killing 4228 miners. Mine safety procedures have been ignored in the quest for profits, especially by those mines owned or partly-owned by local officials. A total of 4,578 officials admitted to having stakes in coal mines. China is seeking solutions from the world, especially South Africa, to improve mining safety. By November, 12,148 mines were ordered shut down for recertification.",

Measures to improve safety include shorter working hours, fire control and ventilation equipment, and a national network of safety inspectors. Automatic gas monitors were installed in 22 gas-rich coal mines. China fired two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and fired or demoted 126 more after accident investigations. China has created a whistleblowers fund to reward citizens reporting negligence and illegal mine investors. Mine safety remains a major challenge as coal represents 67% of China's energy resource.    Government officials have announced that 4,000 small coalmines will be closed by the end of 2005.  One city in north China has imposed huge fines on coalmines for each death in accidents.  In Hunan Province cash awards are offered to those who report officials who illegally own shares in mines.  In December 2005 the government announced that it had dismissed two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and demoted or dismissed 126 other officials blamed for accidents killing 528 people.  Despite such measures the rate of large-scale accidents increases with accidents reported on a near-daily basis.    Accident and death rates continue to increase at China's provincial coal mines, while rates decrease at state-owned facilities. In response, officials will close 4,000 small coal mines annually for three years and further reduce the number through regrouping and mergers. Already, 2,411 mines were closed this year and 12,900 were ordered to suspend production for safety problems. Fines have been established for wrongful deaths, and rewards offered to whistleblowers. Advanced gas monitors were installed in 20-some gas-rich coal mines. Two deputy governors were dismissed, 96 officials were prosecuted, and another 126 officials were demoted or fired for safety violations.    China has set a timetable for solving the problems associated with its thousands of small coalmines. Many of these mines will be closed, an action that won't affect China's demand for coal. Thirteen large coal production bases each capable of turning out 100M tons annually have been approved. In one region, gas monitors have been installed as a safety measure in gas-rich coalmines. Hunan Province is offering cash rewards to people who report on officials who illegally own shares in coalmines. Some officials have been dismissed. By December, 12,990 mines were ordered to stop production due to safety problems.",

        "summary": "Three weeks after Katrina pets are still being rescued. 5,000 plus have been rescued but thousands have perished. Emergency responders are voluntarily assisting but humane societies are requesting a policy that local, state and federal responders will diligently assist with pet rescues. Representatives Lantos and Oberstar are co-sponsoring the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act to force local and state governments to create emergency evacuation plans for pets or forfeit FEMA disaster grant eligibility. Rescued animals are being fostered in prisons and other states as local shelters are overwhelmed. Unprecedented millions of dollars are being donated for pet rescue effort.    Rescue efforts continue for pets abandoned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Some are still found alive, but estimated tens of thousands have already died. By 10 October, some 8,000 animals have been rescued. At least 600 have been reunited with their owners. Tens of millions of dollars have been donated for Katrina animal rescue. Animals have been sent from the Lamar-Dixon shelter and another at Louisiana State University to smaller shelters, foster homes and even prisons across the country to await reunions or adoption. Lamar-Dixon will be shut down on 15 October. Petfinder.com will list pets through 15 December.    Five thousand pets have been rescued but time is running out for the rest. Many animals are sick from consuming contaminated water, garbage and carrion. LSU's Parker Coliseum (Baton Rouge) houses over a thousand rescued pets and Lamar-Dixon expo center (Gonzales) holds up to 2,000, including larger and sicker animals. Staff are from the Humane Society, US Public Health Service, FEMA, and volunteers. Pets are sent to smaller shelters, foster homes, and prisons for longer-term care. Over 600 have been reunited with owners. Rescuing people takes priority but the Humane Society and a bill in Congress urge pet evacuation also.    Tens of millions of dollars have been donated to pet charities because of Hurricane Katrina, but weeks after the storm, abandoned animals are still a major concern.

The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.    Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.    Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit. Seniors choosing a Medicare Part D-approved private drug insurance plan risk loosing their other medical insurance. Employers used Part D federal subsidies to reduce retirees' overall health premiums; others dropped retiree health plans entirely. Of 40 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 28 million will enter Part D.    Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit, which becomes effective January 1, 2006, through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA). If a senior purchases a Part D plan, any prior drug benefit will be voided. The government will not negotiate prices or discounts under the plan. Employers who offer drug coverage to those over 65 are required to provide comparisons of their plan and Part D. Medicare has a hotline and Web site to help people confused by Part D.",

Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, intervened for the parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused involvement. State rulings for the husband ordered the immediate removal of Shiavo's feeding tube. The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.      Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.    Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed &quot;Terri's law&quot; through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.    The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President. As of 19 March the feeding tube had been removed by court order.",

        "summary": "Congress passed and President Bush signed emergency legislation allowing federal review of the Schiavo case. Schiavo's parents hope to override state rulings and have their daughter's feeding tube reinserted. Federal judges refused to reverse the Florida court's ruling. Florida lawmakers refused to re-enter the case after the federal ruling. A Florida court will hear new motions per Governor Bush. However the parents' appeals for reinsertion of the feeding tube were denied. After prolonged legal debates including unprecedented Congressional intervention and five U.S. Supreme Court appeals, Terri Schiavo died 18 days after her feeding tube was removed.    Terri Schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tube was removed by order of a Florida state court judge. Her parents continued to fight to keep their daughter alive. A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted. President Bush signed an unprecedented law to avert her death. Florida lawmakers refused to intervene in her case. An appeals court and US Circuit court also ruled against her family. The US Supreme court turned aside the case of Terri Schiavo.    Michael Schiavo won a malpractice suit concerning Terri's coma in 1993. He first petitioned for feeding tube removal in 1998. After final tube removal in 2005, US District Court Judge James Whittemore refused to order reinsertion. The parents appealed to a three-judge federal appeals panel but were rebuffed. Judge Greer issued an injunction keeping the DCF and police away from Terri. Courts consistently rejected appeals related to abuse allegations or new medical diagnoses, and efforts to block Terri's cremation. The US Supreme Court again declined involvement. A federal appeals court agreed to consider a new hearing but Terri died first.    Terri Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March, thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed by court order. Her husband has requested an autopsy. In the final two weeks of Schiavo's life, at least 47 protestors were arrested and there were numerous appeals to have the tube reinserted. Efforts even included a congressional bill to shift jurisdiction from state to federal courts and President Bush's rush back from Texas to sign that bill. In Florida Governor Bush tried to get custody transferred to the Florida government. And the case bounced back and forth in state and federal courts.",

In August 2004 five churches in Baghdad and Mosul were blown up and in the following two months it is estimated that 15,000 Christians left for Syria and Jordan. Many of the emigrants blamed the attacks not on Muslim Iraqis but on foreigners. By January 2005 the Christian minority was organized into political parties in preparation for the January 30th parliamentary elections. On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.    Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004. Insurgents abducted a Syrian Catholic Archbishop apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians in upcoming elections. Former Archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign to assure the future of Iraqi Christian community. Their rights should be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and financial aid given for return to their lands and homes.    Assyrian Christians in Iraq date to the pre-Islamic first century. Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.    Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors.

        "summary": "On Sept. 22, 2004 the Office of Federal Enterprise Oversight cited numerous accounting irregularities in mortgage giant Fannie Mae (Fannie) headed by Franklin Raines. It was charged that earnings were doctored to inflate executive compensation. Raines could possibly face not only loss of his position, but fines and prison for falsifying financial statements. On Dec. 15 the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie had indeed violated accounting rules. Lawmakers called for return of millions in executive bonuses. Raines received $14 million in salary and $25 million in incentive pay 2001-2003. Raines defended Fannie's accounting.    As late as December 21, 2004, Franklin Raines was said to be still under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for alleged financial accounting manipulations at Fannie Mae. It is not clear if Raines himself was ever under criminal investigation related to criminal charges against Time Warner and AOL, which the two companies together paid over $500 million to settle in December 2004. Those charges stemmed from alleged fraudulent accounting practices dating back to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of AOL's audit committee.    Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae is defending its accounting practices and disagrees with allegations that it violated rules to maximize executive bonuses. Fannie Mae will be investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faces litigation by shareholders. Raines and other executives could not only lose their jobs, but also face fines and prison for knowingly certifying false financial statements. They can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from sale of stock.    Major concerns have arisen over the leadership and credibility of Fannie Mae's CEO Franklin Raines. The regulatory agency known as OFHEO conducted the Initial investigations into Fannie Mae's accounting practices and found that the company had violated accounting rules to present a picture of financial well-being and to maximize executive bonuses. Raines has had to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation. The SEC has opened an inquiry into company accounting practices. The U.S. attorney's office is pursuing a criminal investigation. And eight lawsuits have been filed on behalf of shareholders.",

On Dec. 21 Raines resigned with his departure structured as an early retirement. The directors' decision in favor of Raines' retirement rather than dismissal would reap him $8.7 million in deferred payments and an annual pension of more than $1 million. On Jan. 21, 2005, however, Fannie announced that Raines would be denied the cash bonus that he would have received for 2004.    By October 12, 2004 the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington was investigating Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines, who denied wrongdoing, after a caustic September 22 Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight report vetted by the SEC, charged that Fannie Mae violated Financial Accounting Standard 133 and FAS-91, inflating Fannie Mae's reported net earnings by $9 billion, so that Raines and other top executives received maximum bonuses of $27.1 million vice no bonuses, and got higher, allegedly manipulated, prices for their own sales of Fannie Mae stock. The Justice Department told Fannie Mae to preserve documents related to OFHEO's report.    Raines testified to Congress that he expected to be held accountable if his interpretation of the accounting rules was not accepted. The chief accountant of the SEC ruled that Fannie Mae violated accounting standards overstating its profits by 38 percent since January 2001. Raines is seeking a vote of confidence from the directors as he struggles to survive criminal investigation. Raines retired under pressure from federal regulators. Raines will be denied bonuses for 2004 as Fannie Mae eliminated bonuses for top executives.    The SEC ruled that Fannie Mae had overstated its profits by 38 per cent in the years 2001-2004. The OFHEO held Raines responsible the company's emphasisis on earnings over accuracy and demanded significant changes in senior management. On 21 December, Raines took early retirement with millions of dollars in benefits and stock, plus an annual pension of over one million dollars. The company still faced a Justice Department criminal investigation, an SEC civil investigation, further OFHEO examination of its accounting, and several class-action lawsuits. As of 21 January, Fannie Mae was withholding millions in bonuses for top executives.",

There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.      Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.    The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of &quot;planet.&quot; Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight &quot;inner&quot; planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.     Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. &quot;Planet&quot; has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.",

        "summary": "After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood. Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects. However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument. Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue. The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces. Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313. The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.    A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena). Both might be called &quot;minor planets&quot; or could be considered KBOs. NASA's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto's claim to planethood by finding its second and perhaps third moon. On Jan 20, 2006 NASA launched its New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt which it is scheduled to reach in July 2015. Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto's 1380. The IAU committee continues to deliberate.    Debate continues over what constitutes a planet. Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers (both Pluto and UB313 do). Another suggestion is roundness: this would include these two and likely several others yet unknown. Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate its surroundings, which would exclude Pluto and UB313. Pluto became more interesting when the Hubble telescope discoverd that Pluto had not just one but three moons. Scientific interest in Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission: a nine year trip to Pluto and beyond.     Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term. KBO 2003 UB313, discovered by Michael E. Brown, was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto. Both have surface methane ice. If Pluto is a planet, 2003 UB313 should be too. The Hubble Space Telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto, 30-100 miles in diameter. Pluto and its large moon Charon, close physically and in size, may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between them. At least four KBOs have known moons. Pluto would be the first KBO to have multiple satellites.",

Adzharia was reunited but not Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Conflicts in these regions include officials screening ship passengers, the threatening of boats in Georgian waters, and the suppression of press critical of Saakashvili. He has the support of the United States in efforts to bring democracy to Georgia without war. Meetings are being held with region leaders mediated by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Saakashvili seeks an agreement between Georgia and Russia to be signed by Putin.    Mikhail Saakashvili won the presidency of Georgia in Jan. 2004 vowing to regain the separatist regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adzharia. He was successful in restoring Adzharia but has made little headway in the other two. In May he sent troops into South Ossetia culminating in an indecisive temporary cease-fire agreement in August. The same month he threatened ships bound for Abkhazian ports. He offered &quot;the wildest possible autonomy,&quot; but his bid to open talks was rejected by the Abkhazians. By Jan. 2005 he was promising official proposals to the two by the end of the month.    In January 2004, Saakashvili regained control of Adzharia. Georgia searched ships arriving in Abkhazia. Saakashvili offered &quot;widest possible autonomy&quot; to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgian troops entered South Ossetia despite threats of Russian intervention. Georgian coast guards fired on a Turkish ship near Abkhazia. Georgia threatened withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Georgia and South Ossetia agreed to mutual withdrawal of troops. Georgia said it would not start a war and denied stationing 700 troops on the Abkhazia border. Saakashvilli was to make official proposals to Abkhazia and South Ossetia and finalize a framework agreement on relations with Russia.      Saakashvili's priority is to reunite pro-Russian separatist regions with Georgia. He succeeded in Adzharia, but not in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Saakashvili has sent troops to the regions during times of heightened tensions and engaged in on-again off-again negotiations with the self-proclaimed governments. He ordered Georgian authorities to screen ships arriving in Abkhazia, threatened to sink Russian tour boats, and had coast guards fire on a Turkish ship. He closed down South Ossetia's trade in smuggled Russian goods. Saakashvili is seeking better relations with Moscow to improve relations with the renegade regions, and will soon present official proposals to them.",

On Jan. 7, 2005, with inauguration scheduled for Jan. 12, Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking a new election.    Democrat Christine Grigoire was declared winner in the Washington gubernatorial election two months after election day, winning  by 129 votes out of 2.9 million cast. Republican opponent Dino Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking the extraordinary remedy of a new election. The initial count after the Nov 2 election had Rossi ahead by 261 votes. The first recount reduced his lead to 42 votes. A second recount put Grigoie ahead. An estimated 60% of Washingtonians vote by mail and absentee ballots can be postmarked as late as election day so counting in close races can drag on for weeks.    Until the last days of the campaign, State Attorney General Christine Gregoire (Democrat) was favored to win Washington's 2004 governor's race over wealthy real estate agent Dino Rossi (Republican). Absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day trickled in. Rossi led by 261 votes, triggering a recount required by law if the margin is less than 2000. Following a machine recount, Rossi led by 42 votes. A third count, by hand, took place after Democrats raised sufficient money. Election officials discovered over 700 erroneously rejected or misplaced absentee ballots. Seven weeks after Election Day, Gregoire led by 130 votes, reversing election results.    The race for to be governor of Washington state was extremely close. The initial count showed the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million. The first recount, done by machine, showed him ahead by only 42 votes. The second recount, done by hand, gave Democrat Christine Gregoire a 120-vote lead and she was declared the winner on 30 December, fifty eight days after the election. Rossi has filed a lawsuit, alleging that dead people, felons, and other ineligible voters cast ballots and demanding an unprecedented statewide re-vote. The inauguration may be postponed.",

        "summary": "Christine A. Gregoire was sworn in as the new governor on Jan. 12, 2005. In the first action on Dino Rossi's lawsuit to oust Gregoire the Judge declared that his courtroom and not the Democratic-controlled legislature was the proper forum to investigate the election. The case was scheduled to go to trial May 23. Although Democrats acknowledged human errors in vote counting, they vigorously denied Republican charges of fraud. The lawsuit was dismissed on June 6 for lack of evidence and Rossi did not appeal to the Supreme Court.    Christine Gregoire's inauguration as Washington's governor occurred amid a legal challenge by Republican candidate Rossi. Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that his court rather than the state legislature would investigate the election. The judge ruled that before ordering a new election or declaring Rossi the winner, Republicans would need to prove Rossi received more votes than Gregoire after supposed illegal votes were deducted. Bridges noted that the only proven illegal votes had been for Rossi. Five months after the inauguration, Judge Bridges dismissed the Republican lawsuit. After that ruling, Rossi ended his legal effort to remove Gregoire.    Gregoire was sworn in as governor and proceeded to govern as if elected by landslide, imposing taxes and improving roads. Rossi sued for a revote in Republican-leaning, rural Chelan County, claiming illegal votes by felons and ballot-box stuffing. Most Washingtonians opposed a revote. Constitutional language on contested races was ambiguous. Judge John E. Bridges heard the case without a jury. He dismissed the lawsuit because Rossi's lawyers failed to meet their burden of proof. Most of the proved illegal votes by felons were for Rossi. Rossi ended his efforts to remove Gregoire, who was certified as governor-elect in June 2005.    Democrat Christine Gregoire was sworn in as governor of Washington state on 12 January after an extremely close election. The Republicans sued to overturn the gubernatorial election, charging election fraud. A judge dismissed the lawsuit on 6 June, asserting that there were human errors but no fraud, and Republican Dino Rossi decided to end his 5-month legal fight. Gregoire was declared the winner in late June by the Washington Secretary of State. Meanwhile, by the end of the month Rossi vowed to continue his fight and called for a new vote.",

The rebels vowed never to resume the negotiation process unless the government ends its attacks and withdraws from the troubled area. Peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebel groups have been suspended until January 2005.    The Sudanese government and the People's Liberation Movement promised to conclude two years of talks, now in Naivasha, with a peace accord.

Democrats are threatening filibusters to block her confirmation because her judicial views are considered extreme. The Senate Judiciary Committee engaged in angry debates. Republicans are threatening the 'nuclear option' as a means to end any filibusters. Republicans dismissed a Democratic proposal because it did not include the removal of filibusters. Additional compromise talks ended unsuccessfully. A new proposed agreement would allow Democrats to filibuster only in extreme circumstances. A new confirmation vote date has not been determined.    On April 21, 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to revive the long dormant nomination of Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Brown's nomination had been blocked by Democratic filibuster during President Bush's first term. Senate leaders began negotiations over various compromise proposals on handling judicial nominations with the Republican leaders threatening to rule out the filibuster. By May 17 it appeared that Brown's nomination would not reach the Senate floor for another week or perhaps not until after Memorial Day.    In April 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved and sent for U.S. Senate confirmation, the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reid promised to filibuster against her. Republican Senate Majority leader Frist threatened a parliamentary maneuver to change Senate rules to permanently eliminate filibusters in judicial confirmations, including Supreme Court nominees. Six Republican Senators and six Democratic Senators considered a pact to vote to prevent judicial filibusters, except in &quot;extreme circumstances&quot;, and defeat filibuster rule changes. The vote on Brown's confirmation was expected in late May.    The long-dormant and controversial appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown will soon go before the Senate. Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called the nuclear option that would effectively outlaw filibusters. Moderate Democratic and Republican senators have been trying to work out a compromise that would enable confirmation votes to move forward without such a rule change, so far unsuccessfully. Democrats oppose her nomination, claiming she would advance extremist conservative views, particularly on issues regarding parental notification of abortions for minors. Republicans claim she is independent and hard-working, with an open mind and a lot of common sense.",

Democrats will oppose any filibuster attempts regarding Brown's confirmation but the filibuster rules will remain unchanged. The successful cloture vote to end debate on Brown will now permit an up-or-down confirmation vote. After a 2 year delay Justice Brown was confirmed by a 56-43 vote.    As the Senate debated the issue of filibustering judicial nominations, a bipartisan group of centrist senators kept working on possible compromise solutions.

On June 6 debate on  Brown's nomination opened with Republicans praising her great talent while Democrats deemed her an extreme conservative ideologue. On June 8, 10 Democrats joined Republicans to close debate and the Senate voted 56-43 to confirm Brown.    Just prior to the successful May 24, 2005 cloture vote for the first judicial nominee under Senate consideration (Pricilla Owen for U.S. Appeals Court 5th Circuit) 14 moderate Senators confirmed their mutual pact to: vote for cloture in judicial confirmations, except in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;; not change filibuster rules; and vote for cloture for three less contentious federal judicial nominees, including Brown and Owen. On June 6, the Senate opened debate on Brown's confirmation. On June 7, 10 Democrats joined in the successful vote for cloture for Brown.

Averting a showdown, Senate Democrats and Republicans finally reached a compromise which cleared the way for confirmation votes on California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown's nomination to the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

        "summary": "Talks with North Korea reconvened following a five-week break. The U.S. and North Korea remain at a stalemate on the nuclear weapons program. A joint statement was signed with North Korea agreeing to rejoin the Treaty, to permit international inspectors, and to discontinue their nuclear weapons program. No timetable was determined. The international community promised to provide aid, security, energy assistance and work towards improving relations. The day after signing the statement North Korea reversed their decision to cease the weapons program until they receive a light-water reactor to create electricity.    The September 19, 2005 six-nations agreement included: N.K. giving up its nuclear weapons program; returning to the NPT and IAEA safeguards; The U.S. declared no nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula and no intention to attack N.K.; S.K. reaffirmed it doesn't have and won't deploy nuclear weapons; China, Russia, S.K., the U.S. and Japan agreed give N.K. a light-water reactor; N.K. and the U.S. pledge to respect each other's sovereignty, coexist peacefully, and normalize relations; N.K. and Japan agreed to normalize ties; China, Russia, S.K., Japan and the U.S. gave N.K. energy assistance. Australia offered N.K. energy, aid and expertise.    Talks with North Korea end with the signing of a joint statement. The document states that North Korea agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in return for recognition of its right to nuclear energy.

A Texas scientist attributed Armstrong's performance to his modern training approach, not EPO. A specialist in the fight against doping in sports, however, suggested that Armstrong had used a range of banned substances.    On May 23, 2005 sports newspaper L'Equip reported Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for the 1999 Tour de France, based on urine samples examined outside World Anti-Doping Agency protocols, but linked to Armstrong by L'Equip, in violation of WADA anonymity rules. Tour Director Leblanc accepted the charge uncritically, but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible. The French Sports Minister agreed. USA Cycling, Miguel Indurain, and Ed Coyle defended Armstrong. Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999. An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending. Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Armstrong used other banned substances.    French newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. Armstrong strongly denied the charges and questioned the validity of the tests. USA Cycling, fellow cyclists, scientists and French fans have defended Armstrong. Defenders attacked the report as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound. Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated he had been doping. An Italian specialist believes Armstrong used other drugs, too. However, he has never been found guilty of doping.    A French newspaper accused Lance Armstrong of using the illegal performance-enhancing drug, EPO in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. The laboratory conducting the tests couldn't confirm the samples were Armstrong's, but the newspaper said it decoded the labels from samples identifying Armstrong. Armstrong strongly denies this charge. The director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, who studied Armstrong's physiology from 1992 to 1999, stated that Armstrong's record winning streak is explained by his years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France.",

Hale is currently in federal prison awaiting sentencing for previously soliciting the murder of Lefkow. Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders. Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts. Hale denies any involvement in the murders.     Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's husband and mother were murdered in their home on February 28. They died of multiple gunshot wounds between 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Evidence being analyzed includes broken window glass with a fingerprint, a bloody footprint, .22-caliber shell casings, a bloody mop and cigarette butts. Investigators released composite sketches of two men seen near the home on the day of the killings. A $50,000 reward is being offered for leads in the case. The prime suspect is domestic extremist Matthew Hale, convicted last year of soliciting her murder. He and his supporters deny any involvement.    Once white supremacist Matthew Hale was convicted and in jail for plotting to kill Judge Joan Lefkow, her security detail was dropped. Killers entered her house, had her husband and mother lie on the basement floor, and shot each to death. Police and FBI investigated widely but focused on Hale and his violent supporters. Evidence included a window shard with a fingerprint, a bloody mop and shoeprint, cigarette butts, and 22-caliber shell casings. Witness sightings of two white men waiting in a red Ford Escort produced composite sketches. Investigators seized communication and computer records and offered a $50,000 reward.    The husband and mother of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow were killed in the basement of her Chicago home on 28 February. Investigators found a bloody footprint and fingerprints butts at the scene. There are no suspects. Investigators have questioned relatives, friends, and supporters of Matthew Hale, the leader of a large white supremacist group, who was convicted last year of obstruction of justice and of ordering Lefkow's killing. They also want to question two men seen in a car illegally parked near the home that afternoon. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information in the case.",

        "summary": "The Lefkow murder investigation continues. FBI Director Mueller testified to lawmakers that the case will be solved. Bart Ross confessed to the Lefkow murders in his suicide note. Several years ago Judge Lefkow had dismissed Ross' billion dollar medical malpractice suit. DNA evidence gathered at the murder scene matched Ross' DNA. Gun shells found at the suicide location along with the note recounting details only the killer would know point to Ross as the likely killer. No evidence has been found linking Ross to the Hale supremacist group. Authorities will not close the case before ballistic results are completed.    The Lefkow murder investigation took a surprising turn when Bart Ross committed suicide at a traffic stop on March 9, leaving a handwritten confession in his car. Later that day, a local TV station receive a typed suicide letter, dated February 13, which included a hit list of judges, lawyers and doctors and a handwritten account of the Lefkow killings. Ross felt he was a medical malpractice victim and spent over a decade unsuccessfully pursuing lawsuits. Judge Lefkow, who recently ruled against Ross, was his primary target the day of the killings. DNA evidence confirm he was the killer.    Bart Ross, 57, was pulled over by police in a Milwaukee suburb for a defective taillight. Ross immediately committed suicide with a shot to his head. In his van was a letter describing how after treatment for mouth cancer left him disfigured, Judge Lefkow and others ruined his life by dismissing his medical malpractice suit. He vowed to kill them. On February 28th he hid in a Lefkow closet waiting for the judge, but her family found him first so he killed them instead. DNA from a cigarette butt in the home matched Ross's and he resembled a composite sketch.    The killer of Judge Lefkow's husband and mother, Bart Ross, killed himself on 9 March with a single shot to the head when he was stopped for a routine traffic violation. In his van was a suicide note linking him to the murders. He had pursued a decade-long malpractice suit over severe disfigurement resulting from treatment for a cancerous jaw, a suit Lefkow had dismissed a number of years ago. He wrote that she was &quot;No. 1 to kill&quot; because she had &quot;finished me off.&quot; He had a hit list of 25 other judges, lawyers, and doctors.",

On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.    On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.    Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.    Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries.",

More than 11,500 police and gendarmes in 300 cities and towns had been mobilized. Residents, police and firefighters suffered one death and more than 115 injuries. More than 7500 vehicles were torched. Although the riots were ignited by the accidental electrocution death of two teenagers, President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront inequalities and discrimination among its African and Muslim minorities that fueled the unrest. On Nov. 14 emergency powers were extended for three months.    After long police absence, Sarkozy's October 19 declaration of &quot;war without mercy&quot; on violent suburbs fueled the riots starting October 27. On November 8, France declared a state of emergency, and offered social assistance. By November 11, 118 residents, police, firefighters, and foreign journalists were injured, with $US 235 million total damage. By November 13, torched vehicles exceeded 8,000 and arrests exceeded 2,200. Vehicle torchings and arrests, respectively, November 1 - 12 were: 180/34, ?/?, 517/78, 897/250, 1300/349, 1408/395, 1173/330, 617/?, 482/?, 325/?, 384/162, 315/161. (Before the riots, 3,500 vehicles burned monthly nationwide.) France extended emergency powers on November 14.    With a state of emergency declaration, overnight curfews, and a public meetings ban, violent riots around Paris and throughout France steadily abated. The situation markedly improved by the 18th night. The French cabinet extended emergency police powers for three months to ensure an end to the riots. Some 300 towns and cities were affected and around 11,500 anti-riot forces were mobilized. Damages and casualties were considerable. Over 115 citizens, police officers and firefighters were injured, as were three foreign reporters. A rioter lost a hand throwing a Molotov cocktail. Over 7,500 vehicles were torched and dozens of buildings destroyed.    Rioting and unrest spread to some 300 areas across France. The government declared a state of emergency but left it to local authorities to enact curfews or other measures. Many areas did impose curfews but Paris only banned public meetings. Police were mobilized and made hundreds of arrests. Most rioters are young Arab and black residents who complain of economic misery and discrimination. They burned hundreds of vehicles and other acts of arson. President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront the inequalities and discrimination that fueled the unrest. For years, police had warned that immigrant-dominated slums were about to explode.",

        "summary": "A Russian mini-submarine containing 7 submariners became trapped for 3 days on the sea floor in eastern Russia. The submarine was entangled in fishing nets and/or a coastal monitoring system antenna. Russian rescue attempts to free and raise the submarine were unsuccessful. Russia requested international help. Japan, Britain and the U.S. responded with rescue equipment. The British Navy used a robotic vehicle to free the submarine which then surfaced. The crew were in satisfactory condition and taken for medical examination. Russia's naval equipment has not been upgraded as promised by Putin following the Kursk submarine tragedy.    On Aug. 4, 2005 the Russian navy, working desperately to disengage a small military submarine with seven crew snagged by underwater cables at a depth of 625 feet off the Kamchatka peninsula, called for international help. Japan dispatched four vessels, Britain's Royal Navy sent a submersible Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and the U. S. Pacific fleet sent two vehicles similar to the British. Estimates varied as to how much oxygen remained for the entrapped crewmen. The British vehicle arrived first and on Aug. 7 the submarine was cut loose and the crewmen were found all alive.    For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay. The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system. Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply. When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help. Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts. A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub. All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.    A small Russian submarine with seven crew members was trapped on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula late on 4 August. The Russians tried desperately to pull the sub to shallower waters but those efforts failed. They sought international assistance. Japan sent four naval vessels, the U.S. sent three underwater vehicles, but the British were the first to arrive, with remote control submersibles. They cut away the net or undersea cables trapping the sub, enabling it to rise to the surface after almost three days at the bottom. All seven crew members were alive and well.",

Russian rescuers damaged their underwater robotic vehicle during the rescue attempt making it inoperable. When the British rescue vehicle arrived by air there was no equipment to unload it. Russia is considering purchasing a robotic Scorpio or Panther for underwater rescue operations. Adm. Kuroyedov, head of the Russian Navy, was fired and replaced by Adm. Masorin. Masorin has been charged with improving the Navy. Operation errors by the crew were cited as causing the accident.    Following recovery of the submarine, Russian authorities praised the international rescue effort and thanked Britain, the U.S. and Japan, but questions were soon raised as to why their navy did not have the proper equipment for such an operation. Updated equipment was soon purchased. President Putin ordered an investigation of the accident. On Sept. 4 Putin fired the head of the navy. On Sept 6 the defense minister announced that the submarine accident was a result of outrageous violations of the instructions by senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet and that the crew had made errors.    An investigation uncovered violations of instructions and errors in operating the mini-sub that contributed to the recent accident. Prosecutors accused a naval officer of negligence for damaging Russia's own Venom rescue vehicle, thereby necessitating international assistance. Newspapers criticized the navy for waiting over a day before revealing information about the accident. There are conflicting reports about whether the sub was caught in cables or fishing nets. The Russian navy is considering buying at least one Scorpio and possibly a newer model Panther rescue vehicle. The head of the Russian navy was fired, probably in part because of the accident.    Putin ordered the Defense Minister to launch an investigation. The head of the Navy was fired. A Navy captain was accused of damaging a Russian under-water remote-controlled vehicle in rescue attempts. Five British, one Japanese, and two Americans were given state awards. The seven crew members were given awards for bravery, but later accused of violating operating procedures and causing the sub's entanglement. The Russian navy was considering buying one or two submersible rescue vessels. The rescue cost Russia an estimated $1.5 million.

Authorities fear that a number of recent arson attacks on mosques in England may have been retaliation for the bombings.    The death toll rose to 56 and 44 victims of the bombings remain in hospitals, nine in intensive care. Four of those dead were suicide bombers who carried out the bombings. Police identified three of the bombers by name and said that all four were British of Pakistani origin. Police were able to trace the movements on CCTV of the bombers from their arrival at a carpark until just before the explosions. Armed with warrants, police raided five premises in Leeds; home to a large Muslim population of south Asian origin.    The four bombers were British of Pakistani origin and were among the 56 killed. The bombers left their homes in West Yorkshire and drove a rented a car to Luton, NW of London, where they met a fourth accomplice. Closed circuit television at King's Cross caught them all chatting, then they split up. The mother of one reported him missing after the blasts, leading to identifications and raids on five premises in Leeds, which has a large Moslem population. The alleged bomb-builder was arrested in Egypt. After the bombings, several arson attacks took place on mosques in northwest England.    As of 20 July, the death toll stood at 56, with all victims identified. Police had finished their investigations on site and moved one subway car from the underground tunnel to a police compound for further investigation.  The suspected bombers, all four of whom were killed in the explosions, were Islamic extremists. British of Pakistani origin, the four were captured on closed ciruit TV at King's Cross soon before the bomings. An additional suspect was said to have been arrested in Cairo, Egypt, on 15 July.",

The U.N. Chief, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France and Russia, called for full withdrawal. On March 5 the Syrian President promised pullback to the border. A top UN envoy on March 12 demanded a full withdrawal by April 30, a position supported by the European Union. By April 26 withdrawal was under way and the UN had sent a team to verify whether it was complete.    UN Security Council Resolution 1559 mandated withdrawal of &quot;foreign forces&quot; (Syria's troops and intelligence agents) from Lebanon. After the February 14, 2005 assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri, Anon told Syria to withdraw before April, threatening sanctions. Egypt and Saudi Arabia asked Syria to withdraw by April 30, under the 1989 Taif Accord. Lebanon's pro-Syria government resigned March 1. On March 12 Anon sent envoy Roed-Larsen to Syria with an ultimatum. Syria pledged to withdraw all troops. EU Foreign Ministers asked Syria to rapidly implement its pledge.     The February assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri put Syria under renewed pressure from the international community to abide by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The US, France and other European Union nations urged Syria to comply. Egypt and Saudi Arabia encouraged Syria to withdraw its troops by the U.N. deadline of April 30. Faced with a U.N. ultimatum, on April 3 Syria pledged to remove all troops and intelligence agents by April 30. The U.N. sent a team of inspectors to verify whether the withdrawal was complete at the end of April.    The killing of Lebanon's former PM Rafiq Hariri renewed calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of Lebanon. Nine council members voted for the resolution, six abstained. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable for withdrawal of its troops. The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that withdrawal must be handled with care. Under mounting pressure, Syria has withdrawn 4,000 of its 14,000 troops.",

A UN team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops and intelligence officials from Lebanon after a 29-year presence. International pressure following the assassination of Raafik Hariri was more of a factor leading to the withdrawal than the UN resolution.

Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter. Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt. No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations. Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.    In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the Prime Ministry.    Ukraine's October 31 presidential elections reduced the candidates from 24 to two, pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovich and pro-west Viktor Yushchenko. The November 21 runoff election results are being disputed. Yushchenko is claiming Yanukovich's victory is the result of an illegal electoral commission decision and is demanding they be annulled. While campaigning, Yushchenko was struck by a mysterious illness in September and spent most of the month in an Austrian hospital. He and his supporters believe he was poisoned by political rivals. Doctors are still examining blood and other samples to determine the cause. They expect him to make a full recovery.    Ukrainian presidential elections were extremely close between the two leading candidates, pro-West Yushchenko and pro-Russia Yanukovich. Runoff elections on 21 November resulted in a standoff, with Yushchenko refusing to recognize Yanukovich as President and calling for new elections, and with Yanukovich saying that he would appoint Yushchenko Prime Minister. In September Yushchenko was treated in Vienna for a mysterious illness which paralyzed and scarred part of his face. Supporters claimed that the illness, which occurred after a meeting with the former head of the KGB, was an assassination attempt. Doctors said that they did not know the cause.",

        "summary": "Specialists in several countries confirmed that Viktor Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned with pure TCDD, a lethal form of dioxin which causes disfigurement and long term health issues. The poisoning investigation is ongoing. The earlier disputed presidential election was declared fraudulent and invalid by the Supreme Court. A repeat election was mandated. Foreign observers will help secure an honest election. Yushchenko was elected president of the Ukraine with 51.99 percent of the vote. As he took the oath of office Yushchenko vowed to improve economic conditions in the Ukraine. Viktor Yanukovych vowed to appeal the election results to the Supreme Court.    The Ukraine Supreme Court invalidated the November 21 election, due to election fraud. Yushchenko's ingested poison was identified as pure TCDD, a rare highly toxic form of Dioxin. Yushchenko deferred criminal investigations until after the repeat election December 26. Parliament failed to pass Yuschenko's election reforms, but the Constitutional Court ruled for expanded home voting, which helped Yushchenko. Yushchenko supporters pushed for Yanukovich's resignation; instead he took a leave of absence to run his campaign. The dual U.S.-Ukraine citizen Yushchenko won the Presidency 51.99% to 44.20% for Yanukovich. Yanukovich said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, without much hope.    In December, doctors determined conclusively that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned with the most lethal form of dioxin. Prosecutors reopened a criminal investigation into his attempted murder. Yushchenko was sure that Ukrainian authorities were responsible. He fell ill on September 6, after having food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine and others. The Ukraine Supreme Court overturned the November runoff election results due to fraud, and Parliament enacted new anti-fraud election reforms in December. Yushchenko won a repeat runoff on December 26 and took office in January, his face still disfigured by the poison.    Yushchenko was sworn in as President of Ukraine on Sunday 23 January. In a third round of voting on 26 December, Yushchenko won 51.99% of the vote to Yanukovich's 44.20%. The Supreme Court had annulled the results of the second round of voting because of election fraud. That decision followed 17 days of massive popular protests called the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; after Yushchenko's campaign color. Doctors confirmed that Yushchenko had been deliberately poisoned with TCDD, the most lethal form of dioxin. Blood tests revealed levels of dioxin &quot;more than 1000 times&quot; normal. Yushchenko will need treatment for months if not years.",

Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ becomes invasive cancer in 40 percent of patients over 40 years. Combined chemotherapy and hormone therapy cut death in half within 15 years from recurring breast cancer. Consuming 33.3 fat grams daily reduces breast cancer recurrence 30% over five years. Exercise increases breast cancer survival 50%. Low melatonin levels in night-time workers increased breast cancer. Benign &quot;proliferative&quot; lesions correlate with later breast cancer. At 65 and older, early smaller localized tumors accounted for 96% of survival improvement; 38% under 50.    The drug Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients. Scientists reported that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat might reduce the chance that their tumors will return. A study showed that walking for three to five hours per week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent. Another study examining the role of childhood diet plays in breast cancer found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.    Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2. A low-fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence. Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades, can be mistaken as benign, and can take 40 years to develop. Night shift workers, women with benign breast lesions, and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer.     Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized. There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer. Studies have shown that both low-fat diets and exercise can increase survival rates for  breast cancer patients. But eating french fries in childhood can lead to cancer in adulthood. Night workers seem to have a higher incidence of breast cancer, indicating that there may be a relationship between tumor developent and exposure to light.",

At least one YMCA has introduced a fitness room designed for pre-teens.

To combat childhood obesity in the US, schools are removing unhealthy food from vending machines, reducing the fat in lunches, and requiring more physical education. New Hampshire is instituting twice-yearly weigh-ins for students. Children's hospitals have weight management programs and a YMCA has a kid-friendly fitness room. Efforts are being made to regulate advertising to young children. Manufacturers offer cereals low in sugar and salt with more vitamins and whole grains. US Cabinet secretaries and children's television networks are promoting healthier lifestyles for children. In New Zealand, schools added a mandatory extra hour of physical activity for students every week.    Scientists say reversing childhood obesity requires wide-ranging efforts. Less time should be spent in front of the computer and television. Schools should remove junk food from vending machines and reduce the fat in cafeteria lunches. Experts recommend reducing sugar consumption. Changes need to be made in food labeling and advertising as well as more school and community recreational facilities and physical education programs. Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or who are embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids.      Measures to fight childhood obesity include less time at the TV and computer, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school and community physical education programs and education to help children make better choices. The children's network Nickelodeon is encouraging children to go outside and play. They have also awarded grants to schools to expand physical play.

The pair's lobbying for Indian tribes and Pacific islanders was shown to have benefitted the lobbyists and political associates while bilking the clients of millions of dollars. The House majority leader and a congressman were implicated. On Nov. 18, 2005 Michael Scanlon was charged with fraud and scheduled to go to court on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information, typically a prelude to pleading guilty and giving full cooperation with government investigators.    Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal. The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas. The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio. Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal. Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.    The Senate Indian Affairs Committee charged Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and fund-raiser, with running a crude extortion racket that has bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, additional congressmen and House aides are under an ethics investigation resulting from their connections with Abramoff. His activities in the Northern Marianas are also being investigated. Abramoff has been indicated in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and his partner, Michael Scanlon, was charged with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars.     Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff is being investigated in connection with manipulating elections and extorting lobbying fees of $66 million from six Indian tribes related to protecting gaming franchises, and $9 million from the Northern Mariana Islands related to the textile industry. Investigations also involve Abramoff's purchase of a gambling cruise ship company and arranging unreported golf junkets to Scotland. Abramoff invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Senate hearing. Also implicated are Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his former aide Michael Scanlon, Ralph Reed, Representative Robert W. Ney, and David Safavian.

His help was expected to be crucial in the Justice Department's wide-ranging Abramoff investigations. On Dec. 28, 2005 the Justice Department was urgently pressing Abramoff to settle fraud and bribery allegations as the investigation continued. A court date was set for Jan. 9, 2006 as Senate and criminal investigations continued. On Jan. 3 Abramoff pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. He agreed to provide evidence and testimony in the Justice Department's probe of corruption in Congress and executive branch agencies.    Michael Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe public officials and agreed to pay back over $19 million to Indian tribal clients. His possible 5-year prison sentence could be reduced should he cooperate with prosecutors. Abramoff pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion charges and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He did not identify officials by name. The next day he pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy in Florida. Panicked lawmakers, including President Bush, rushed to distance themselves from Abramoff by returning campaign money he gave them. The money is being returned or redirected to charities.    Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with federal officials investing political corruption. Abramoff is also facing trial on fraud charges in Florida connected with purchasing a casino cruise chip company. In his plea agreement, Abramoff committed to making 25 million in restitution to his victims and paying 1.2 million to the IRS for tax evasion. His prison sentence could be lowered depending on assistance he provides in the corruption investigation of as many as 20 members of Congress or top congressional aides.    Abramoff's extensive corruption schemes are the subject of a Senate probe and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and Florida prosecutors. Investigators are looking at congressmen, aides, government officials, and lobbyists, including Rep. John Doolittle, Stephen Griles, and Tony Rudy, and will follow the case wherever it leads. Scanlon pled guilty to bribery and agreed to make restitution to tribes. His help would be crucial to the Abramoff investigation.

        "summary": "On Thanksgiving Day Stewart was able to enjoy a visit from her family, a privilege normally limited to weekends. By Christmas she was calling for sentencing reform particularly for drug and first-time offenders. By mid-January Stewart had tried her hand at ceramics and crocheting. As she completed her term in March she was 20 pounds lighter, having taught yoga and foraged for greens on prison grounds as well as abhorring the food. After leaving Alderson at 12:30 a.m. on March 3, 2005, Martha Steward declared the 5-month experience as &quot;life altering and life affirming.&quot;    Martha Stewart spent Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's in prison. Her job there was cleaning. During her stay, she did ceramics, crocheted, taught yoga, decorated the chapel for a memorial service, became an expert on vending-machine snacks, and foraged the grounds for fresh greens for the prison salads. She was grateful for the support of her friends, family, colleagues, and fans. Stewart became a prison reform advocate through her experience. She emerged from the Alderson prison on March 4 with head held high, 20 pounds lighter and a lot wealthier, since shares in her company nearly tripled in value.    In a Christmas message posted on her personal web site, Martha Stewart called for sentencing reform. She suggested pushing for reforms in federal sentencing guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders and particularly for drug offenders, who would be better served in rehabilitation than prison. She is scheduled to be released in early March 2004 and then must spend five months under house arrest. Her company announced that Stewart would host a daytime talk show after her sentence. Since her conviction, her company's share price has nearly tripled increasing her personal stake.    At Alderson Martha had time to think, became a more sympathetic character, and got wealthier as her company's share price tripled. Her family visited at Thanksgiving. Martha's prison job was cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming and raking leaves. Via her website Martha received 15,000 fan e-mails, and said she was safe, fit and healthy but found the loss of freedom and privacy difficult. Fellow inmates shielded her from paparazzi. She picked wild greens to augment the bad food, lost 20 pounds, learned to crochet, taught yoga, tried ceramics, decorated the chapel, ordered seeds for her garden at home, and made to-do lists.",

BTK had taunted police with letters to them and the media, but efforts to find him failed and in 1979 the letters ceased. They resumed in March 2004 and the investigation of the BTK case reopened. Forensic experts studied DNA swabs that Kansas Governor Sibelius says linked Rader (BTK) to his victims. Little else has been revealed as to how the perpetrator of these crimes was identified and tracked down.    After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas &quot;BTK serial killer&quot;, Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005. He was held for 10 first-degree murders, from 1974 to 1991, but won't get Kansas's death penalty instituted in 1994. Local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI worked 31 years on 5,000 tips and evidence provided by BTK: eight letters to police and media, a victim's necklace BTK gave to his girl friend, a victim's driver's license, BTK's recorded voice and crime scene semen, thousands of DNA swabs, BTK's DNA linking to Rader, and facts matching Rader's biography.    Wichita police arrested the BTK strangler during a traffic stop on February 25. Dennis Rader, serial killer of at least 10, sent numerous taunting messages and clues in the 1970's before going silent in 1979. In March 2004, he mailed evidence of a previously unattributed 1986 murder to the Wichita Eagle. More letters, clues and evidence followed. Thousands of tips poured in and police received help from forensics experts. Police long believed BTK graduated from Wichita State University, as Rader had. DNA evidence helped solve the case. Police learned of the last two BTK victims upon his arrest.    Wichita police announced the identification and arrest of serial killer BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill). He is Dennis Rader, a 59-year old church leader and government inspector who police believe murdered ten people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities for their inability to catch him. Police received more than 5,000 tips when BTK resurfaced in 2004 after two decades of silence. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation. Law enforcement officials revealed nothing about the evidence they have against Rader. According to Governor Sebelius DNA evidence linked him to crime scenes.",

There was much public speculation and some media reports of possible links between Rader and BTK including talk of a computer disc and DNA evidence, but investigators remained tight-lipped. On March 1 Rader was charged with 10 murders with bail set at $10 million. On April 19 Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing at which the prosecution would explain how the police had tied Rader to the killings. This, as the DA said, &quot;prolongs the agony of the public to know.&quot;    Rader's daughter did not turn her father in to police. Wichita investigators continue examining other killings, for possible linkage to BTK. Reportedly, DNA from Rader's daughter facilitated his identification. A computer disk in Rader's final mailing linked to his church. On March 31 Rader was charged with 10 first-degree murders. Bail was $10 million. His next court appearance was March 15. Rader waived his April 19 preliminary hearing. He would plead not guilty at arraignment May 3, and not plead insanity or plea bargain. Rader is no longer secluded from other prisoners. Kansas expected to pay $405,000 for Rader's defense.    Evidence identifying Dennis Rader as the BTK killer was found on a computer disk he mailed to a television station on February 16. Experts linked the disk to a computer at Christ Lutheran Church, where he served as the church council's president. Rader broke his 25-year silence after the Wichita Eagle published an article marking the 30th anniversary of the first BTK killings. Prosecutors cannot yet present their evidence against Rader because he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Nearby law enforcement agencies are reinvestigating cold cases that bear similarities to the BTK slayings.    Investigators continue to examine unsolved killings over the last 31 years to determine if any can be linked to BTK. Prosecutors cannot seek the death penalty for Rader since the killings occurred before its enactment. For three decades, BTK had toyed with Wichita in letters, poems and packages. It was his most recent mailing to a TV station that helped crack the case: a computer disk traced to the computer at Rader's church. The disk along with DNA evidence led to Rader. Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is expected to plead not guilty.",

Colombian police may have kidnapped a FARC rebel in Venezuela.     FARC rejected a government proposal to hold talks aimed at exchanging rebels for hostages held by the guerillas. FARC asked the president to grant them the two southern demilitarized zones, before discussions could take place. The government denied their request because it has to guarantee the safety of the people across the country. The United Nations urged hostage release. The rebel groups released 12 hostages. The Columbian government plans to pardon more than 30 members of FARC as they negotiate a prisoner swap.    FARC rejected the government proposal for talks aimed at exchanging jailed rebels for hostages unless two southern counties were demilitarized. The government rejected that demand but released 50 jailed guerillas to build confidence. FARC followed with release of five kidnap victims. FARC killed another indigenous leader, Pervis Pacheco of the Kankuamo Indians and are believed to have killed the leader of Arhuaco Indians. Columbia's Supreme Court approved extradition of a FARC chief, among others, to the US to face charges of narco-trafficking and money laundering. The government was to pardon 23 FARC members as the two sides negotiate prisoner exchanges.    The Colombian government again refused FARC's request for two southern demilitarized zones before prisoner exchange discussions. FARC holds 1600 hostages. Police arrested a top FARC assassin responsible for over 50 assassinations, including a mayor and town councilor, and ordering hostages killed when families failed to pay ransoms. FARC killed four indigenous leaders of the Kankuamo, Yanacona and Arhuaca Indians. The government released 50 jailed guerrillas and pardoned 23. Five FARC rebels died in a clash with the army. Colombia approved extradition of a FARC chief to the US. A FARC leader was seized in Venezuela and moved to Colombia.",

Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham insisted there was nothing wrong with his living on a yacht owned by the executive of MZM, Inc. for which he had helped gain government contracts or selling a San Diego home for $1,675,000 to the executive who resold it for $975,000. On July 1 federal agents raided Cunningham's San Diego residence and the MZM offices and yacht in Washington. Cunningham soon announced that he would not seek reelection and the executive stepped down. On August 13 Cunningham asked donors for permission to use their campaign contributions for legal expenses.    By July 2005 U.S. Representative Randall Cunningham was under investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the IRS and a federal grand jury probe. He received defense contractor MZM Inc's PAC money and personal donations from MZM President, Mitchell Wade. Wade paid a supposedly inflated price for Cunningham's and Cunningham paid Wade questionably little money to live on Wade's yacht in DC. Cunningham promoted MZM defense contracts, contributed to and served on a Wade-run charity board, and spoke at an MZM company party. Cunningham requested donors' permission to transfer campaign funds to his legal defense fund.    The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating Rep. Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor, Mitchell Wade, for an inflated price. Agencies are probing Wade's efforts to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts. Cunningham was living on Wade's yacht, which has also raised questions about improper financial links. He defended his boat arrangement as proper saying that he paid fees and services in lieu of rent. Cunningham is asking his contributors, including Wade, for permission to use their campaign donations for his legal defense.    Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, R-California, is a favorite of defense contractors who contribute heavily to his political campaign. The CEO of one company, MZM, Mitchell Wade, contributes to Cunningham's campaign and PAC, but  supports the congressman in other ways. When in Washington, Cunningham lives aboard Wade's yacht docked at a Potomac River yacht club and pays only docking fees. Wade purchased Cunningham's home in San Diego for over  $1.6M and a few months later sold it for a $700,000 loss suggesting that Cunningham was paid an inflated price. After that sale, Cunningham bought another home for over $2.5M.",

India's space program is developing on several fronts. India is planning an unmanned moon mission to map the moon's surface and produce a chemical map of the moon. Experiments from five countries (the U.S. and four European nations) are short-listed for this satellite. It has an agreement with France to launch a satelite perhaps in 2008 to make climate predictions more accurate. It will set up a telemedicine system, linking doctors at the best hospitals with patients across India.

India has signed an agreement with the European Space Agency and is talking with NASA regarding their participation in India's unmanned lunar launch. India's launch of the INSAT-4A has been delayed by the European Space Agency. Boeing cancelled their agreement with India to jointly produce communication satellites. India and Russia are collaborating on the development of a youth communication satellite.    For the first time, India is set to launch two satellites in a single mission. One is for mapping and the other for communications. India will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Some 225 delegates including many from the US, China, Japan, Canada, France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia will attend. The ISRO announced the payloads from the US, Bulgaria, Germany and Britain for the Chandrayaan-1 mission. Launch of the Indian INSAT-4A communications satellite from French Guyana has been delayed. India and Russia are working on a satellite for communication between youths of the two countries.    India's space program began in 1972. It aspires to be a major space power. India developed a unique universal launching pad and plans a sophisticated propellant plant for its launch vehicle, delayed by sanctions following India's 1998 nuclear testing. India has launched eleven remote-sensing satellites and two satellites in one mission. Communication satellites include Hamsat for Ham radio and distance-learning Edusat. India and Russia plan a youth communication satellite. In 2005 ISRO hosted international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Europe's Ariane program problems delayed launch of India's telecast and communication satellite INSAT-4A. Boeing withdrew from Indian satellite cooperation.     The Indian Prime Minister has criticized economic sanctions imposed after the 1998 nuclear weapons tests, but noted that these have not hindered India's scientific progress. India launched one rocket carrying two satellites, one for more detailed mapping, the other for home radio operators. Its first unmanned moon mission, scheduled for 2007-2008, will carry three European payloads and perhaps one U.S. payload. Meanwhile India is working with Russia to develop a satellite to enable youths in the two countries to communicate. It will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law for about 225 delegates in June.",

Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena. The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.    Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.    After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient. Baseball executives and players union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for the current season.    Major League Baseball players Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco admitted taking steroids. Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez are accused or suspected of steroid use. Caminiti claimed half the players used them. 5-7 percent of players tested positive in 2003 and 1-2 percent in 2005. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig investigated steroid use in 1998 and urged banning over-the-counter sales. A pamphlet in English and Spanish on steroids' effects was distributed to players. Drug tests for players began in 2004. Some steroids became controlled substances. Congress held hearings on baseball steroid use.",

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig admitted the League's policy is not strong enough and has proposed much stricter penalties. They include a 50-game suspension for the first offense and a lifetime ban for the third one. These penalties would apply to minor-league players next year. Selig also requested amphetamines be added to the banned substances. Congress has threatened to implement a testing system unless the League strengthened its policy. The Players Association has not responded to the proposed penalties.    Under pressure from Congress, Major League Baseball's players association toughened drug testing rules and penalties again for the 2006 season. Suspensions will be increased to 50 games for a first offense, 100 for a second, and a lifetime ban for the third. Congress launched an undercover probe into illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball. News of the probe surprised MLB officials. Rafael Palmeiro was suspended 10 days for a positive steroid test. He denied intentionally taking the drug. Other players with 10-day steroid test suspensions were Felix Heredia and Carlos Almanzar. New doping allegations surfaced about Barry Bonds.    Congress has launched an undercover probe into illegal steroid use in major league baseball. To highlight the problem, baseball heavy hitters Mark McGuire, Raphael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa testified before the responsible congressional committee. In a letter to the players' union, Selig proposes a 50-game suspension for first offenders instead of the current 10-game suspension. A second offense would result in a 100-day suspension and a third, a lifetime ban. The players' union has concerns since several steroid agents stay in the blood stream for a long period. A one-time user who swore off could show positive in future testing.     Congressional investigators chided Major League Baseball leaders for being uncooperative regarding steroid use and urged star players to take public responsibility for their actions. Congress also launched an undercover probe. Players proposed strengthening the collective bargaining steroid proposal. Bud Selig proposed a 50-game suspension for first offenders, 100-game suspension for second, and lifetime ban for third. 2003 tests showed 104 steroid users. Eleven players were suspended for steroids in 2005. Felix Heredia, Carlos Almanzar and Rafael Palmeiro tested positive.

        "summary": "Barack Obama, a black state senator in Illinois, first came to national attention with his electrifying keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He went on to win overwhelmingly in the race for U.S. Senator. He was outstanding for his inclusive rhetoric, ability to attract support of liberals and white middle-class voters, and his fund raising for his own and other Democratic candidates. While running his own campaign he stumped for other candidates in more than a dozen states. In November 2004 Barack Obama was already being touted as a future presidential candidate.    Barack Obama graduated Harvard Law School as the first black President of the Harvard Law Review. In 2004 three-term Illinois State Senator Barack Obama won the U.S. Senate seat, with support from white liberals, the white middle class and Chicago south side blacks, to become the third black U.S. Senator in 150 years. He raised a $14 million campaign fund, and gave $400,000 to other Democratic candidates. His lauded keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention kindled such star power he was recruited to stump in a dozen states for presidential nominee John Kerry.    Barak Obama, who was a relatively obscure Senate hopeful just a few months ago, soundly defeated his opponent to become the third African-American US Senator in history. The charismatic Obama catapulted to prominence after giving an electrifying keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. In the following weeks, he came to have such star power that he was recruited to stump for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry and fellow congressional candidates. He draws the support of voters from all racial and economic groups. Obama is widely touted for a future leadership position in his party.    Barack Obama studied at Columbia and Harvard and led the Harvard Law Review. He became a community organizer in Harlem and Chicago, a civil rights lawyer, and three-term state senator. He won a senatorial nomination over six others in March 2004. He rose to national prominence after his keynote address at the Democratic Convention in July. Annie Leibowitz photographed him for Vanity Fair. He raised $14 million for his campaign and donated to other Democrats. In October he won a landslide victory over Alan Keyes with cross-racial support. He was touted as a future party leader or even presidential candidate.",

Obama won a Grammy Award for his readings of his autobiographical book Dreams From My Father, which became a best seller as he became a rising political star.    At a sold-out luncheon for black alumni at Harvard Law School, Obama was introduced as a rock star and hero.

He visited Israel and met with the Prime Minister and mended a rift with John McCain over lobbying reform.

These laws are more likely to pass and maintain their constituents support. The cell-phone industry states that the percentage of accidents caused are very low. Judging cell-phone law results are difficult due to the lack of clear evidence in accidents except from witnesses or driver admissions. Driver education is a large part of cell-phone law enforcement. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey prompted the Department of Defense to restrict driver cell-phone use on military facilities. Enforcement policies vary by military base.      In 2005, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones while driving. Bills were passed or are still being considered in 22 states. The National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to restrict young drivers because teens account for a large share of traffic fatalities and cell phone use increases the problem. However, enforcing laws for young drivers is difficult. Both the U.S. Virgin Islands and Lackland Air Force Base have cell phone laws in place.    Every state has considered legislation on cell phones behind the wheel but only a few have banned them unless they are hands-free. Connecticut and Chicago have joined New York, New Jersey and DC in prohibiting use of hand-held phones. Many states have put limits on teens using cell phones while they drive. Enforcement of laws banning cell phone use while driving is a problem. Nearly everyone supports the laws, nearly everyone ignores them. The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use by motorists but left it for the military services and individual bases to decide how to enforce it.    The US Virgin Islands now bans hand-held cell phone use while driving. Eleven states including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland and Tennessee ban cell phone use by young drivers. California prohibits phone use while driving by bus drivers but not others. Under a Pentagon directive, bans on cell phone use while driving are becoming common on military bases. In 2005, 38 states tried to pass restrictive legislation. Effectiveness is difficult to assess because drivers or witnesses must confirm cell phone use coincided with accidents. Enforcement is difficult because officers can't easily ascertain drivers' ages or if they are using hands-free phones.",

        "summary": "In August 2003, former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, accepted asylum in Nigeria from 17 counts of war crimes in Sierra Leone. He has been accused of violating the asylum agreement by harboring Al-Qaeda terrorists, interfering with Liberian presidential elections and an assassination attempt on the Guinea President. The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.    Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.    After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea. In March 2006 the new Liberian president requested Taylor be released to Sierra Leone vice Liberia. President Bush and Obasanjo were to discuss Taylor on March 29.    Former Liberian President Charles Taylor fled to Nigeria in August 2003 and is under house arrest at a riverside villa in Calabar. Taylor regularly defies restrictions against travel, political activity or media contact. He is actively trying to destabilize West Africa, spending money he looted from Liberia. Taylor meddles in Liberian affairs, harbors members of Al-Qaeda, and ordered an assassination attempt against Guinea's President Conte. Nigerian President Obasanjo agreed to turn Taylor over to Liberia but is pressured to send him to war crimes court in Sierra Leone where Taylor is under indictment for crimes against humanity while backing rebels.",

A northern pipeline delivers gas to Germany, France and England. A central one connects Turkey to Romania, Bulgaria and Austria. The southern one supplies Greece and Italy from Turkey. The pipeline to Germany circumvents the concept of a common European policy with Russia. Russia has a monopoly agreement on gas exported from Kazakhstan produced in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russia's actions are viewed as applying political pressure on neighboring countries. The pipelines are expected to begin operating between 2007 and 2010.    Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas group and the German company BASF plan a Baltic Sea pipeline to transport Russian gas directly to Europe. The pipeline will be launched in 2010, three years from the original estimate. It will make landfall in northern Germany then continue to the Netherlands and across the English Channel. Austria and Bulgaria plan a gas pipeline from Turkey through Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to Austria. Construction is to begin on a Turkey-Greece pipeline to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe. An underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy is part of the plan.    Russia's Gazprom will control the Northern European Gas Pipeline, bringing Siberian gas directly to Europe. It will bypass Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, who fear being cut off from Russian gas. Gazprom and Germany's BASF will build it. Gerhard Schroeder, criticized for profiting from a project he supported while German chancellor, will chair the board. Gazprom arranged a monopoly on gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Kazakhstan. The Austria-Bulgaria &quot;Nabucco&quot; project is a gas pipeline from Turkey to Austria. A Southern Europe Gas Ring from Turkey through Greece and across the Ionian Sea to Italy is to be completed by 2006.    The Northern European Gas Pipeline, which will bring gas from Northern Siberia through Russia and under the Baltic Sea to northern Germany, then to the Netherlands and under the English Channel to Britain. Poland, the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine are critical of the pipeline, because it bypasses current transit routes through those countries. The Southern Europe Gas Ring project is to transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea area and Central Asia through Turkey and Greece then under the Ionian Sea to Italy. Construction of the Turkey-Greece segment is scheduled to start in July 2005.",

The reduction was critically viewed as a foreign policy tool. Ukraine, accused of gas theft, responded that the withdrawal was routine. Russia was charged with acts of terror in pipeline explosions in Georgia. Croatia and Hungary are considering an Adriatic Sea pipeline to decrease reliance on Russia. The European Union imports some gas from Russia but parts of Europe are mainly Russia dependent. A proposed trans-Caspian pipeline linking gas directly to the West bypassing Russia is causing renewed conflicts.    Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and to expand its markets. However, Russia's disruption of gas supplies to Europe during freezing weather raised concerns about the company's ability to ensure steady fuel supplies. Pipelines supplying Russian gas go through Ukraine and each country blames the other for the shortage. Croatia and Hungary are weighing construction of a pipeline from the Adriatic Sea to bring Middle Eastern gas to Europe and decrease reliance on Russian gas. Russia has opposed a US-backed pipeline project that would bypass Russia and link Central Asian gas fields directly to the West.    Faced with mounting criticism, Russia restored gas withheld from Ukraine in an alleged pricing dispute but suspected to be Moscow's meddling in Ukraine's internal politics. Steady fuel supplies from Gazprom became questioned. Austria proposed a gas pipeline from Iran to Austria as part of Nabucco. Gas pipeline explosions in January 2006 were blamed on both Moscow and terrorists. Croatia and Hungary are considering a liquified petroleum gas terminal on the Adriatic coast and a pipeline to Europe to decrease reliance on Russian gas. A US-backed trans-Caspian pipeline is proposed that would bring Central Asian gas to Europe and bypass Russia.    Russia cut the flow of natural gas through the Ukrainian pipeline in early January because of a pricing dispute. The resulting European energy crisis made European governments question Russia's reliability and seek alternative sources. Austria is weighing the construction of a pipeline from Iran through Turkey and the Balkans. Croatia and Hungary are considering a pipeline to bring liquid gas from North Africa and the Middle East. The U.S.supports a proposed pipeline under the Caspian Sea to bring gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Pipeline explosions cut Russia's gas supply to Georgia and Armenia.",

The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire &quot;inadequate,&quot; &quot;insufficient,&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;    President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.     President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.    President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; and asked her to redo it.",

Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated. Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House, but the committee chair denied intruding on executive privilege. Democrats blamed the failure on right-wing ideologues. Sen. Lott (R-MS) blamed it on a nomination based on cronyism. On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned her conservative credentials, lack of judicial experience and criticized her for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House. Others said the White House bungled the nomination from the start. Many agreed that although she is a very capable person, President Bush shouldn't have chosen someone not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     President Bush announced that Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court. The announcement was met with a blend of regret, relief and a feeling that she had been treated poorly. Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents. Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling and the White House had capitulated to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Right Wing partisans expressed relief and some jubilation at her withdrawal.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court three and a half weeks after its initial announcement. Bush declared on 27 October that his choice had withdrawn her name and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her decision. She claimed that the fight over her nomination would be a burden for the White House. She also said that she wanted to protect the independence of the executive branch, citing the battle over access to her White House legal writings. She will continue to serve as White House counsel. Bush promised to name a replacement &quot;in a timely manner.&quot;",

The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years. The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker. There have been 15 sightings captured on video although researchers can't determine how many were seen. The government proposed $10 million for efforts to protect the bird. Private groups will contribute another $10 million.     The ivory-billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed. There have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during more than 7,000 hours searching.    The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp. Its existence has been confirmed by at least 8 sightings, a 4-second video, and its distinctive &quot;double-knock&quot; drumming. The first sighting was in February 2004 but was kept secret for over a year while experts confirmed the discovery and protected the bird's territory. Private groups and individuals have raised $10 million for protection of the woodpecker and its environment, while the federal government has proposed $10 million in federal funds.

They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird. But they and others remained skeptical. In December over 100 researchers and volunteers began an intensive six-month search across 500,000 acres of Arkansas wetlands seeking definitive evidence of the bird. A local town benefited from bird watching tourists. In January 2006 Jackson published an article saying claims for proof of the bird's existence constitute &quot;faith-based ornithology&quot;.    Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker. The issue is whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker. Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence. A crew from Cornell Lab and its partner agencies will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search of 500,000 acres in the eastern Arkansas wetlands. An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker.    Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct. However, more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts. Cornell ornithologists made 17,000 hours of recordings near the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas. The discovery raised concerns that this habitat could be inundated with bird watchers. Cornell will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search for the bird. Federal authorities have provided $10.2M toward the effort and the Nature Conservancy has bought 18,000 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside for the bird.    The rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker was challenged in late April, almost three months after its announcement. Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient, a conclusion also reached by Sibley, author of well-known field guides. But two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge and the paper was not published. In January 2006, however, the third biologist voiced the strongest criticism to date, saying that he was still not convinced. The search continues.",

The administration staged a counter-demonstration. After Akayev won overwhelming election victories the opposition charged the government with mass election violations, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and held a regional governor and a district chief hostage. Akayev ordered investigation and negotiations and fired the interior minister and prosecutor general while police dispersed crowds in Bishkek.    In February 2005 rallies in Bishkek urged President Akayev to step down as promised and constitutionally required after October presidential elections, fearing a referendum to continue his reign. Akayev supporters won a landslide parliamentary victory. Opposition leaders and the European Organization for Security and Cooperation charged the elections were flawed. By March 16 opposition forces rallied, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, demanded Akayev's resignation, and took hostage a regional governor and district chief. On March 20 four policemen were beaten after police fired shots at demonstrators. Akayev ordered investigations into election fraud charges and fired the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Kyrgyz oppositionists, fearing President Akayev might hold onto power longer than his constitutional two terms, rallied and urged him to step down. He refused, saying elections were fair, opposition leaders were unnecessarily inciting civil war, and talks were the solution to the crisis. The opposition refused to accept a landslide victory by Akayev supporters in parliamentary elections and claimed fraud. They blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and took a governor and district chief hostage. When police fired shots to dispel rioters, crowds beat four policemen to death. Akayev ordered fraud claims investigated and replaced the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 27 February, with presidential elections planned for October. Akayev supporters won a landslide victory in most areas, but both opposition leaders and western observers cited mass violations. Run-off parliamentary elections were held in many regions on 13 March. The opposition was defeated but refused to accept the results and demanded Akayev's resignation. Even before the election, opposition leaders had been calling for Akayev to step down as President at the end of October in accordance with the constitution.

        "summary": "On March 24, 2005 mass protests outside the presidential compound in Bishkek turned violent. Demonstrators broke into the building and beat several officials severely. Akayev fled the country for Russia and soon announced in Moscow that he would resign if the Kyrgyzstan government would guarantee his safety. On April 3 a Kyrgyzstan parliamentary delegation arrived in Moscow and after 3 hours of talks Akayev signed a resignation document. He also taped an 18-minute farewell address to be played in Bishkek while he remained in Moscow. New presidential elections are scheduled for June 26.    On March 24, 2005 protestors stormed the main Kyrgystan government building and Akayev fled to Russia. The elected pro-Akayev parliament nonetheless elected an Akayev opponent as Speaker and called for new presidential elections on June 26. On April 3, Akayev signed his resignation in Moscow, which was notarized in lieu of a constitutional requirement that he present his resignation in person to parliament. Because his safety still could not be guaranteed, due to continued calls for his impeachment, his recorded resignation was to be heard and accepted by a special session of parliament on April 6 and broadcast live.    Opposition against Akayev strengthened with international criticism for election abuses, his government's crackdown on opposition groups and independent media, and his failure to bring those responsible for killing six peaceful demonstrators in 2002 to justice. Poverty and widespread corruption contributed to public anger. Akayev fled to Russia after opposition supporters stormed the main government building and mobs looted parts of Bishkek. He resigned as president in Moscow, with impeachment the alternative. In his address to the nation, Akayev apologized to people who bore him grudges, hoped the presidential election would be democratic, and said he wouldn't fight the new government.    Massive uprisings continued in Kyrgyzstan, fueled by anger over the rigged parliamentary elections. When protesters finally stormed the presidential compound on 30 March, President Akayev fled to Moscow. Two nights of looting and gunfire followed in Bishkek. A delegation headed by the new speaker of Parliament went to Moscow to negotiate with Akayev. Akayev signed his formal resignation at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow on 4 April. His recorded statement was to be shown to Parliament and then broadcast on national television. Presidential elections are now scheduled for 26 June.",

He could face up to three years in prison. The US and EU called on Turkey to drop the charges. His December 16 trial was suspended until February 7 because the court lacked a justice ministry order to proceed. The case has stirred outrage across Europe. EU officials were there to observe the trial, the outcome of which could damage the Turkey's chances of joining the EU.    Prominent Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk, was indicted over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres. Pamuk is charged under Turkey's penal code which carries a jail term of more than three years for a person who &quot;explicitly insults&quot; the Turkish republic. The European Union (EU) warned Turkey that its prosecution of Pamuk could damage its chance of joining the EU and is a test of Turkey's commitment to freedom of expression and reforms in its law. European countries, U.S. and activist organizations have criticized Turkey's lack of democratic principles and citizen's rights.     In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage. He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for &quot;public denigration of the Turkish identity,&quot; carrying up to 3 years in jail. Turkey says the deaths were fewer and from civil unrest, not genocide. The US, European Union, and activist organizations criticized Turkey's criminal charges for freedom of expression. The EU said Pamuk's trial would affect Turkey's EU bid. A Turkish court ruled Pamuk should be tried under old laws requiring justice ministry direct order and postponed the trial.    Orhan Pamuk went to court on 16 December for outspoken comments made during a Swiss newspaper interview about the Armenian massacres. The EU warned that the trial could affect Turkey's EU accession process because it would indicate the strength of Turkey's commitment to recent reforms guaranteeing freedom of expression. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said, &quot;It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial, but Turkey.&quot; The trial was suspended until 7 February pending a decision from the Justice Ministry. The offense had been made before the new penal code had gone into effect and therefore came under the old law.",

        "summary": "Turkey was heavily criticized by international human rights groups over Orhan Pamuk's trial. Turkish intellectuals and EU officials demanded that Turkey change the laws that limit freedom of expression. To avoid an EU confrontation, Turkey's justice minister sent Pamuk's case back to the local Istanbul court, which then dropped the charges on a technicality. The EU welcomed the ruling, which came just days before it was to begin a review of Turkey's justice system. Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.      A group of 169 Turkish intellectuals asked the government to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression and interfere with Turkey's democratic process. Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk stating that it wasn't legally competent to judge this case. The court was chided for framing the dismissal in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing freedom of expression. About 70 intellectuals have been charged as well, but they don't have the same high profile as Pamuk. The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases.    Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to rule on whether Pamuk should be tried, citing recent penal code amendments. It sent the case back to the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk. The case divided Turkey and embarrassed its liberals. Pamuk's remarks also highlighted another painful episode in Turkish history, the 30,000 Kurdish deaths in recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's Kurdish southeast. Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression. Potential EU partners wanted to know that Turkish laws were the same as laws elsewhere in the EU.    The case against Orhan Pamuk ended on 23 January. The Justice Ministry had refused to issue an approval of the prosecution and told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed. The Istanbul court dropped the charges. Pamuk's lawyer criticized the decision, saying that it was framed in bureaucratic terms and avoided the issue of freedom of expression. Turkish nationalists were outraged. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said that Pamuk was not the only one facing such charges, he was &quot;just the most high-profile case.&quot; PEN says that some 70 Turkish intellectuals have been charged with similar offenses.",
