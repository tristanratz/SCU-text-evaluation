    "summary": "The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.",

    "summary": "Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate.",

    "summary": "China sacrificed coal mine safety in its massive demand for energy. Gas explosions, flooding, fires, and cave-ins cause most accidents. The mining industry is riddled with corruption from mining officials to owners. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production. South Africa recently provided China with information on mining safety and technology during a conference. China is beginning enforcement of safety regulations. Over 12,000 mines have been ordered to suspend operations and 4,000 others ordered closed. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. China's mines are the most dangerous worldwide.Chinese coalmines are said to be the most dangerous in the world.  January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004.  Accidents included explosions, floods and cave-ins.  The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.China's accident-plagued coal mines cause thousands of deaths and injuries annually. 2004 saw over 6,000 mine deaths. January through August 2005, deaths rose 8.5% over the same period in 2004. Most accidents are gas explosions, but fires, floods, and cave-ins also occur. Ignored safety procedures, outdated equipment, and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem. Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill-managed and illegally-run mines, punishing errant owners, issuing new safety regulations and measures, and outlawing local officials from investing in mines. China also sought solutions at the Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held in Beijing.China will close 8,648 coal mines during October 2005, for renewal of safety certificates in view of the large number of mine accidents causing loss of life. During the first nine months of the year, there were 2337 accidents killing 4228 miners. Mine safety procedures have been ignored in the quest for profits, especially by those mines owned or partly-owned by local officials. A total of 4,578 officials admitted to having stakes in coal mines. China is seeking solutions from the world, especially South Africa, to improve mining safety. By November, 12,148 mines were ordered shut down for recertification.",

    "summary": "The distress of Hurricane Katrina evacuees forced to choose between rescue and pets has prompted a review of disaster preparedness. Evacuees expected to return within days to rescue their pets instead of the weeks that have passed. Humane and animal welfare organizations are mounting search and rescue efforts and providing shelter and medical treatment. They have requested federal, state and local assistance. Soldiers are being re-deployed for animal rescue. More than 4,000 animals have been rescued with some being sheltered in other states. Animals are micro-chipped and photographed to assist in reunification. Monetary and animal supplies donations are continuing.Hundreds of animal welfare workers and volunteers from the gulf coast and across the nation are working to rescue pets stranded by Hurricane Katrina. The Humane Society, SPCA and other organizations have joined the effort. The ASPCA has received donations of over $5.25 million, and shipments of food and supplies. Nearly 4,000 animals have been rescued, and 300-400 have been reunited with their owners. Hundreds of animals arrive daily at the Lamar-Dixon Center in Gonzales, LA where about 2,000 are housed. The animals are photographed, micro chipped and documented before being shipped to other shelters. Pictures are posted on Petfinder.com.Hurricane Katrina evacuees were forced to abandon possibly 50,000 dogs, cats, birds and other pets. Volunteers with the Humane Society, the ASPCA, other groups, and soldiers searched for pets trapped in houses and left food for animals roaming streets. Rescued pets were taken to Gonzales, LA and Hattiesburg, MS. 4,000 pets had been rescued by 9/13/05 and a small fraction reunited with owners. To ease overcrowding some dogs were relocated to other states after being photographed, microchipped and documented. Pet photographs were posted on the website petfinder.com. Federal, state and local assistance was requested. The ASPCA received over $5.25 million.Hurricane Katrina has left thousands of animals stranded in New Orleans. Many pet owners were forced to abandon their animals in the evacuation of the city, although some owners stayed, refusing to leave without their pets. The Humane Scociety and the SPCA are doing their best to rescue the animals, which include dogs, cats, horses, reptiles, and even a sea lion and a tarantula. Web sites are being used to try to reunite pets and their owners. And many animals are being photographed, microchipped, and documented and then shipped to shelters and foster homes in other states.",

    "summary": "Prescription drug plan Medicare Part D has been launched with a bombardment of information to seniors. The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit. Seniors choosing a Medicare Part D-approved private drug insurance plan risk loosing their other medical insurance. Employers used Part D federal subsidies to reduce retirees' overall health premiums; others dropped retiree health plans entirely. Of 40 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 28 million will enter Part D.Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit, which becomes effective January 1, 2006, through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA). If a senior purchases a Part D plan, any prior drug benefit will be voided. The government will not negotiate prices or discounts under the plan. Employers who offer drug coverage to those over 65 are required to provide comparisons of their plan and Part D. Medicare has a hotline and Web site to help people confused by Part D.",

    "summary": "The 7 year legal battles between the husband and parents of Florida resident Terri Schiavo over whether to extend her life artificially continue with day to day countermanding legal rulings including Florida's Supreme Court. Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, intervened for the parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused involvement. State rulings for the husband ordered the immediate removal of Shiavo's feeding tube. The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed \"Terri's law\" through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President. As of 19 March the feeding tube had been removed by court order.",

    "summary": "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked to the press that Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, was an undercover CIA agent. Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration. Administration staffers Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby are the focus of the investigation. NY Times correspondent Judith Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify about Libby. Libby was eventually indicted on five counts: 2 false statements, 1 obstruction of justice, 2 perjury. Libby resigned immediately. He faces 30 years in prison and a fine of $1.25 million if convicted. Libby pleaded not guilty.On October 28, 2005 Lewis Libby was indicted on two counts of making false statements, two perjury counts and obstruction of justice, by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into possible intentional, illegal revelation of the identify of CIA covert operative Valerie Plame. Libby's testimony was contradicted by several witnesses. No others were indicted as the grand jury was extended and Karl Rove remains under investigation. Libby will fight the charges, which have maximum penalties of 30 years and $1.25 million. Judith Miller had been jailed 85 days before testifying and surrendering notes, after Libby formally rescinded their confidential source agreement.Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into the naming of Valerie Plame as an undercover CIA agent has led to a parade of newspersons and White House staffers before the Grand Jury. Columnist Robert Novak first revealed Plame, whose husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson had contradicted one of President Bush's justifications for war against Iraq. New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed 85 days for refusing to testify about Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Vice President's Staff Chief. WH Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove is under investigation. Libby resigned after being indicted on five felony counts. He has pled not guilty.After a nearly two-year investigation in the CIA leak case, Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, Vice-President Cheney's chief of staff, was indicted on felony charges of perjury, making false statements to FBI agents, and obstruction of justice for impeding a federal grand jury. Libby resigned immediately. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and a 1.25 million dollar fine. He said he plans to fight the charges. Karl Rove, President Bush's deputy chief of staff and close political advisor, was not indicted but still faces the possibility of prosecution as the investigation continues.",

    "summary": "Christians constitute about three percent of Iraq's population of 25 million. In August 2004 five churches in Baghdad and Mosul were blown up and in the following two months it is estimated that 15,000 Christians left for Syria and Jordan. Many of the emigrants blamed the attacks not on Muslim Iraqis but on foreigners. By January 2005 the Christian minority was organized into political parties in preparation for the January 30th parliamentary elections. On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004. Insurgents abducted a Syrian Catholic Archbishop apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians in upcoming elections. Former Archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign to assure the future of Iraqi Christian community. Their rights should be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and financial aid given for return to their lands and homes.Assyrian Christians in Iraq date to the pre-Islamic first century. Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors. In mid-January, just before the upcoming elections, a Catholic archbishop was kidnapped by gunmen in Mosul.",

    "summary": "W. Mark Felt, former Deputy Director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration has ended speculation and admitted to being the mysterious Deep Throat. Felt made his revelation via his lawyer in a Vanity Fair article. The Washington Post was completely blindsided after keeping Felt's secret for 30 years. Reactions to Felt's admission varied from being declared a hero to being called a criminal. Many felt relief at no longer being suspects. Former Nixon aides decried Felt as disloyal and unethical. Bob Woodward is publishing his book on Deep Throat now instead of upon Felt's death as previously planned.A report in Vanity Fair identifying 1972-73 Watergate leaker \"Deep Throat\" as the FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt, was verified by Felt's grandson on May 31, 2005. Felt is now 91 and in ill health. Editor Bradlee and reporters Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post who had kept the secret for over 33 years quickly confirmed the identification. After years of speculation individuals expressed dismay, condemnation, praise and \"I told you so!\" On June 2 it was announced that Bob Woodward's book on \"Deep Throat\" would be published in July.Retired FBI official Mark Felt revealed himself to be the Watergate informant Deep Throat in a Vanity Fair article, ending 33 years of speculation. The revelation surprised everyone, particularly reporters Woodward and Bernstein, who vowed to keep his secret until after his death. Political celebrities, pundits, and minor Watergate figures now claim to have known all along. Felt is being hailed as a hero, denounced as a traitor and accused of partisan politics. A number of other Deep Throat suspects are relieved to be exonerated. Newspapers claim it is an example of how anonymous sources can keep government in check.Retired FBI official Mark Felt revealed in a Vanity Fair magazine article that he was the source known as Deep Throat, famous during the Watergate scandal. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had pledged to keep Deep Throat's identity a secret until his death. After Felt's acknowledgement the two reporters confirmed that the now enfeebled 91-year old Felt was indeed Deep Throat. Felt's announcement ended years of speculation as to Deep Throat's identity and it freed those who were suspected from having to constantly deny that role. Former Nixon associates denounced Felt but others considered him a hero.",

    "summary": "On Sept. 22, 2004 the Office of Federal Enterprise Oversight cited numerous accounting irregularities in mortgage giant Fannie Mae (Fannie) headed by Franklin Raines. It was charged that earnings were doctored to inflate executive compensation. Raines could possibly face not only loss of his position, but fines and prison for falsifying financial statements. On Dec. 15 the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie had indeed violated accounting rules. Lawmakers called for return of millions in executive bonuses. Raines received $14 million in salary and $25 million in incentive pay 2001-2003. Raines defended Fannie's accounting.As late as December 21, 2004, Franklin Raines was said to be still under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for alleged financial accounting manipulations at Fannie Mae. It is not clear if Raines himself was ever under criminal investigation related to criminal charges against Time Warner and AOL, which the two companies together paid over $500 million to settle in December 2004. Those charges stemmed from alleged fraudulent accounting practices dating back to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of AOL's audit committee.Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae is defending its accounting practices and disagrees with allegations that it violated rules to maximize executive bonuses. Fannie Mae will be investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faces litigation by shareholders. Raines and other executives could not only lose their jobs, but also face fines and prison for knowingly certifying false financial statements. They can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from sale of stock.Major concerns have arisen over the leadership and credibility of Fannie Mae's CEO Franklin Raines. The regulatory agency known as OFHEO conducted the Initial investigations into Fannie Mae's accounting practices and found that the company had violated accounting rules to present a picture of financial well-being and to maximize executive bonuses. Raines has had to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation. The SEC has opened an inquiry into company accounting practices.

    "summary": "Debate continues on whether Pluto discovered in 1930 is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO). Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt. There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of \"planet.\" Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight \"inner\" planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. \"Planet\" has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.",

    "summary": "After Mikhail Saakashvili replaced Eduard Shevardnadze as the Georgian President he vowed to reunite the separatist pro-Russian regions of Georgia and fight against corruption. Adzharia was reunited but not Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Conflicts in these regions include officials screening ship passengers, the threatening of boats in Georgian waters, and the suppression of press critical of Saakashvili. He has the support of the United States in efforts to bring democracy to Georgia without war. Meetings are being held with region leaders mediated by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Saakashvili seeks an agreement between Georgia and Russia to be signed by Putin.Mikhail Saakashvili won the presidency of Georgia in Jan. 2004 vowing to regain the separatist regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adzharia. He was successful in restoring Adzharia but has made little headway in the other two. In May he sent troops into South Ossetia culminating in an indecisive temporary cease-fire agreement in August. The same month he threatened ships bound for Abkhazian ports. He offered \"the wildest possible autonomy,\" but his bid to open talks was rejected by the Abkhazians. By Jan. 2005 he was promising official proposals to the two by the end of the month.In January 2004, Saakashvili regained control of Adzharia. Georgia searched ships arriving in Abkhazia. Saakashvili offered \"widest possible autonomy\" to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgian troops entered South Ossetia despite threats of Russian intervention. Georgian coast guards fired on a Turkish ship near Abkhazia. Georgia threatened withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Georgia and South Ossetia agreed to mutual withdrawal of troops. Georgia said it would not start a war and denied stationing 700 troops on the Abkhazia border. Saakashvilli was to make official proposals to Abkhazia and South Ossetia and finalize a framework agreement on relations with Russia.Saakashvili's priority is to reunite pro-Russian separatist regions with Georgia. He succeeded in Adzharia, but not in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Saakashvili has sent troops to the regions during times of heightened tensions and engaged in on-again off-again negotiations with the self-proclaimed governments. He ordered Georgian authorities to screen ships arriving in Abkhazia, threatened to sink Russian tour boats, and had coast guards fire on a Turkish ship. He closed down South Ossetia's trade in smuggled Russian goods. Saakashvili is seeking better relations with Moscow to improve relations with the renegade regions, and will soon present official proposals to them.",

The following day Democrat Gregoire led by 1400; the next day Gregoire by 21,234; and by Nov. 16 Rossi by 19. By Nov 18 all votes were counted and Rossi led by 261. A machine recount gave Rossi a 42-vote edge but a manual recount gave Gregoire a lead of 261. On Dec. 30 Gregoire was declared Governor-elect. On Jan. 7, 2005, with inauguration scheduled for Jan. 12, Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking a new election.Democrat Christine Grigoire was declared winner in the Washington gubernatorial election two months after election day, winning  by 129 votes out of 2.9 million cast. Republican opponent Dino Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking the extraordinary remedy of a new election. The initial count after the Nov 2 election had Rossi ahead by 261 votes. The first recount reduced his lead to 42 votes. A second recount put Grigoie ahead. An estimated 60% of Washingtonians vote by mail and absentee ballots can be postmarked as late as election day so counting in close races can drag on for weeks.Until the last days of the campaign, State Attorney General Christine Gregoire (Democrat) was favored to win Washington's 2004 governor's race over wealthy real estate agent Dino Rossi (Republican). Absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day trickled in. Rossi led by 261 votes, triggering a recount required by law if the margin is less than 2000. Following a machine recount, Rossi led by 42 votes. A third count, by hand, took place after Democrats raised sufficient money. Election officials discovered over 700 erroneously rejected or misplaced absentee ballots. Seven weeks after Election Day, Gregoire led by 130 votes, reversing election results.The race for to be governor of Washington state was extremely close. The initial count showed the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million. The first recount, done by machine, showed him ahead by only 42 votes. The second recount, done by hand, gave Democrat Christine Gregoire a 120-vote lead and she was declared the winner on 30 December, fifty eight days after the election. Rossi has filed a lawsuit, alleging that dead people, felons, and other ineligible voters cast ballots and demanding an unprecedented statewide re-vote. The inauguration may be postponed.",

    "summary": "Sudan and Darfur's two main rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, signed a ceasefire in Ndjamena in April, 2004. On October 6, the UK prime minister visited Sudan to discuss Darfur. AU-lead peace talks in Abuja between those Darfur rebels and Sudan ran August 23 through September 17, reconvened October 21, but were suspended by the AU on October 27. Libya hosted a \"mini-summit\" with leaders of Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, Chad and the JEM in Tripoli on October 17-21; SLA declined. EU and AU officials met October 23-24 in Khartoum with the Sudan President.Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, called for a Darfur mini-summit to be held on October 21, 2004 in Sirte, Libyan. Gadhafi invited the presidents of Sudan, Egypt, Chad, Nigeria and the leaders of Darfur's two rebel groups. Talks between Darfur rebels and the Sudanese government were held in Abuja, Nigeria in August and September 2004. The next round of talks will be held as part of the Darfur mini-summit, which was switched to Tripoli. This was done to obtain cooperation from neighboring countries, which is crucial to lasting peace.Libya and the African Union have invited Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to attend a mini-summit in Libya on October 21st with Chad, Egypt and Nigeria. Originally set for Sirte, Libya, the meeting was later shifted to Tripoli. Earlier talks had been held in Abuja in August and September. The Sudanese Liberation Army would not attend the Libyan meeting. British PM Tony Blair planned to meet in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian President and current AU chairman Olusegun Obasanjo. Peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebel groups in Abuja, Nigeria, adjourned but would resume after Ramadan.The latest Darfur peace talks opened on 24 October in Abuja, Nigeria. Sponsored by the African Union, the meetings between Khartoum and the Darfur rebels were expected to last at least three weeks. The meetings were adjourned on Wednesday morning so that AU mediators could prepare a document for discussion that same afternoon. An earlier AU summit in Abuja concerning the Darfur crisis collapsed on 18 September when the two sides disagreed on security issues. Foreign ministers from Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, and Chad had met in Libya on 16 October to prepare for that summit.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Senate remains deadlocked in confirmation proceedings for Justice Janice Rogers Brown for the U.S. Appeals Court in the District of Columbia. Democrats are threatening filibusters to block her confirmation because her judicial views are considered extreme. The Senate Judiciary Committee engaged in angry debates. Republicans are threatening the 'nuclear option' as a means to end any filibusters. Republicans dismissed a Democratic proposal because it did not include the removal of filibusters. Additional compromise talks ended unsuccessfully. A new proposed agreement would allow Democrats to filibuster only in extreme circumstances. A new confirmation vote date has not been determined.On April 21, 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to revive the long dormant nomination of Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Brown's nomination had been blocked by Democratic filibuster during President Bush's first term. Senate leaders began negotiations over various compromise proposals on handling judicial nominations with the Republican leaders threatening to rule out the filibuster. By May 17 it appeared that Brown's nomination would not reach the Senate floor for another week or perhaps not until after Memorial Day.In April 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved and sent for U.S. Senate confirmation, the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reid promised to filibuster against her. Republican Senate Majority leader Frist threatened a parliamentary maneuver to change Senate rules to permanently eliminate filibusters in judicial confirmations, including Supreme Court nominees. Six Republican Senators and six Democratic Senators considered a pact to vote to prevent judicial filibusters, except in \"extreme circumstances\", and defeat filibuster rule changes. The vote on Brown's confirmation was expected in late May.The long-dormant and controversial appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown will soon go before the Senate. Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called the nuclear option that would effectively outlaw filibusters. Moderate Democratic and Republican senators have been trying to work out a compromise that would enable confirmation votes to move forward without such a rule change, so far unsuccessfully. Democrats oppose her nomination, claiming she would advance extremist conservative views, particularly on issues regarding parental notification of abortions for minors.

    "summary": "North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is in a standoff with six other nations. North Korea's position is that nuclear weapons are needed for their defense. The negotiations with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the UK and the US to persuade North Korea to cease its nuclear weapons programs are continuing without much progress. North Korea demands to be treated as a nuclear power and for disarmament talks to apply to all countries involved. South Korea has proposed that the international community aid North Korea economically and institute a rehabilitation program once the nuclear issue is resolved.In February 2005 North Korea declared it manufactured nuclear weapons and won't rejoin six-nation talks (North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, U.S.). In May the IAEA reported N.K. had close to six nuclear weapons. N.K. and S.K. resumed direct talks. In July N.K. returned to six-nation talks after the U.S. recognized N.K.'s sovereignty. S.K. offered N.K. food, electricity, APEC membership, a multinational rehabilitation fund, and to establish a Northeast Asian Development Bank, if N.K. abandons nuclear weapons, which the U.S. called \"premature\". N.K. said it would return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after its nuclear weapons program was resolved.North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after the United States accused the country of having a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it has already built nuclear bombs. Since 2003, the six-nation (United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia) talks have aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and economic benefits and security guarantees.Several rounds of six-party tallks on North Korea's nuclear program have broken down since August 2003 without an agreement. South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia want North Korea to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. Pyongyang insists on having nuclear power for peaceful purposes, something opposed by the U.S. South Korea has promised massive aid to North Korea, including electricity, rice, and other necessities, if an agreement can be reached within the six-party framework. It has also suggested a rehabilitation program for the North, a proposal that the U.S. and Japan strongly oppose.",

    "summary": "On August 23, 2005 the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe charged that Lance Armstrong used the drug EPO in 1999. Armstrong strongly denied the charge. The French sports minister, the Tour de France director and the chief executive of the USCycling said that since the tests used as a basis for the charges were inadequate no action would be taken against the cyclist. A Texas scientist attributed Armstrong's performance to his modern training approach, not EPO. A specialist in the fight against doping in sports, however, suggested that Armstrong had used a range of banned substances.On May 23, 2005 sports newspaper L'Equip reported Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for the 1999 Tour de France, based on urine samples examined outside World Anti-Doping Agency protocols, but linked to Armstrong by L'Equip, in violation of WADA anonymity rules. Tour Director Leblanc accepted the charge uncritically, but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible. The French Sports Minister agreed. USA Cycling, Miguel Indurain, and Ed Coyle defended Armstrong. Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999. An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending. Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Armstrong used other banned substances.French newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. Armstrong strongly denied the charges and questioned the validity of the tests. USA Cycling, fellow cyclists, scientists and French fans have defended Armstrong. Defenders attacked the report as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound. Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated he had been doping. An Italian specialist believes Armstrong used other drugs, too. However, he has never been found guilty of doping.A French newspaper accused Lance Armstrong of using the illegal performance-enhancing drug, EPO in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. The laboratory conducting the tests couldn't confirm the samples were Armstrong's, but the newspaper said it decoded the labels from samples identifying Armstrong. Armstrong strongly denies this charge. The director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, who studied Armstrong's physiology from 1992 to 1999, stated that Armstrong's record winning streak is explained by his years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's mother and husband were shot at her home in an apparent retaliation for her contempt order against Matthew Hale, a previous defendant in a civil copyright lawsuit with white supremacist elements. Hale is currently in federal prison awaiting sentencing for previously soliciting the murder of Lefkow. Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders. Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts. Hale denies any involvement in the murders.Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's husband and mother were murdered in their home on February 28. They died of multiple gunshot wounds between 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Evidence being analyzed includes broken window glass with a fingerprint, a bloody footprint, .22-caliber shell casings, a bloody mop and cigarette butts. Investigators released composite sketches of two men seen near the home on the day of the killings. A $50,000 reward is being offered for leads in the case. The prime suspect is domestic extremist Matthew Hale, convicted last year of soliciting her murder. He and his supporters deny any involvement.Once white supremacist Matthew Hale was convicted and in jail for plotting to kill Judge Joan Lefkow, her security detail was dropped. Killers entered her house, had her husband and mother lie on the basement floor, and shot each to death. Police and FBI investigated widely but focused on Hale and his violent supporters. Evidence included a window shard with a fingerprint, a bloody mop and shoeprint, cigarette butts, and 22-caliber shell casings. Witness sightings of two white men waiting in a red Ford Escort produced composite sketches. Investigators seized communication and computer records and offered a $50,000 reward.The husband and mother of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow were killed in the basement of her Chicago home on 28 February. Investigators found a bloody footprint and fingerprints butts at the scene. There are no suspects. Investigators have questioned relatives, friends, and supporters of Matthew Hale, the leader of a large white supremacist group, who was convicted last year of obstruction of justice and of ordering Lefkow's killing. They also want to question two men seen in a car illegally parked near the home that afternoon. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information in the case.",

    "summary": "Rioting by young Muslim men broke out in a Paris suburb on the night of Oct. 27, 2005. Cars were torched, windows smashed, and policemen stoned. On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries.",

    "summary": "A Russian mini-submarine containing 7 submariners became trapped for 3 days on the sea floor in eastern Russia. The submarine was entangled in fishing nets and/or a coastal monitoring system antenna. Russian rescue attempts to free and raise the submarine were unsuccessful. Russia requested international help. Japan, Britain and the U.S. responded with rescue equipment. The British Navy used a robotic vehicle to free the submarine which then surfaced. The crew were in satisfactory condition and taken for medical examination. Russia's naval equipment has not been upgraded as promised by Putin following the Kursk submarine tragedy.On Aug. 4, 2005 the Russian navy, working desperately to disengage a small military submarine with seven crew snagged by underwater cables at a depth of 625 feet off the Kamchatka peninsula, called for international help. Japan dispatched four vessels, Britain's Royal Navy sent a submersible Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and the U. S. Pacific fleet sent two vehicles similar to the British. Estimates varied as to how much oxygen remained for the entrapped crewmen. The British vehicle arrived first and on Aug. 7 the submarine was cut loose and the crewmen were found all alive.For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay. The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system. Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply. When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help. Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts. A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub. All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.A small Russian submarine with seven crew members was trapped on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula late on 4 August. The Russians tried desperately to pull the sub to shallower waters but those efforts failed. They sought international assistance. Japan sent four naval vessels, the U.S. sent three underwater vehicles, but the British were the first to arrive, with remote control submersibles. They cut away the net or undersea cables trapping the sub, enabling it to rise to the surface after almost three days at the bottom. All seven crew members were alive and well.",

    "summary": "During the morning rush hour on July 7, terrorists exploded bombs on three London subway trains and a double-decker bus, killing at least 52 and injuring 700. A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility. The attacks were timed to coincide with the G-8 summit meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland. Forensic evidence indicates that each bomb contained less than 10 pounds of possibly military-grade high explosives, and all were made by a single bomb maker. There is not yet evidence as to whether suicide bombers were involved. Police are close to identifying someone responsible for the bus attack.Four coordinated bombings struck central London on July 7, three in subway cars and one on a bus. The blasts killed 52 persons and sent 350 to hospitals where 22 remain critical. An additional 350 were treated for light injuries. Hot, dusty conditions in subway tunnels hampered rescue operations. PM Tony Blair returned to London from the Group of Eight meeting in Scotland after the bombings. Police said each bomb contained less than ten pounds of military-grade explosives and did not rule out suicide bombers as responsible. A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility.Four coordinated bombs exploded in central London during morning rush hour on July 7th, coinciding with the G8 summit in Scotland. About 700 were injured and 52 killed. Three bombs were on subway trains and one on a bus. Each was small enough to fit in a rucksack. The Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility, to avenge British involvement in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. No evidence arose of suicide bombers. Investigators viewed video by cameras on streets and subway platforms around London. Londoners took the terrorist attacks in stride, used to IRA bombs and the WWII blitz.Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in London during the morning rush hour on Thursday 7 July. Bombs exploded on three subway trains and one double-decker bus. The bombs all contained similar components: military-grade explosives under 10 pounds, small enough to fit into a backpack. The explosions killed at least 52 people and injured more than 700. Investigations at the tunnel site were slow, hampered by very high heat, asbestos dust, and twisted metal. Investigators do not know how many suspects they are looking for, but reported progress toward identifying one of the bombers.",

    "summary": "Syria's withdrawal of forces from Lebanon, required by UN Resolution 1559, Sept. 2, 2004, was not satisfied by Syria's proposal on Feb. 24, 2005 to pull back into eastern Lebanon. The U.N. Chief, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France and Russia, called for full withdrawal. On March 5 the Syrian President promised pullback to the border. A top UN envoy on March 12 demanded a full withdrawal by April 30, a position supported by the European Union. By April 26 withdrawal was under way and the UN had sent a team to verify whether it was complete.UN Security Council Resolution 1559 mandated withdrawal of \"foreign forces\" (Syria's troops and intelligence agents) from Lebanon. After the February 14, 2005 assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri, Anon told Syria to withdraw before April, threatening sanctions. Egypt and Saudi Arabia asked Syria to withdraw by April 30, under the 1989 Taif Accord. Lebanon's pro-Syria government resigned March 1. On March 12 Anon sent envoy Roed-Larsen to Syria with an ultimatum. Syria pledged to withdraw all troops. EU Foreign Ministers asked Syria to rapidly implement its pledge.The February assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri put Syria under renewed pressure from the international community to abide by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The US, France and other European Union nations urged Syria to comply. Egypt and Saudi Arabia encouraged Syria to withdraw its troops by the U.N. deadline of April 30. Faced with a U.N. ultimatum, on April 3 Syria pledged to remove all troops and intelligence agents by April 30. The U.N. sent a team of inspectors to verify whether the withdrawal was complete at the end of April.The killing of Lebanon's former PM Rafiq Hariri renewed calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of Lebanon. Nine council members voted for the resolution, six abstained. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable for withdrawal of its troops. The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that withdrawal must be handled with care. Under mounting pressure, Syria has withdrawn 4,000 of its 14,000 troops.",

    "summary": "The Ukrainian presidential election race to replace President Kuchma is close and competitive. Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter. Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt. No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations. Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the Prime Ministry.Ukraine's October 31 presidential elections reduced the candidates from 24 to two, pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovich and pro-west Viktor Yushchenko. The November 21 runoff election results are being disputed. Yushchenko is claiming Yanukovich's victory is the result of an illegal electoral commission decision and is demanding they be annulled. While campaigning, Yushchenko was struck by a mysterious illness in September and spent most of the month in an Austrian hospital. He and his supporters believe he was poisoned by political rivals. Doctors are still examining blood and other samples to determine the cause. They expect him to make a full recovery.Ukrainian presidential elections were extremely close between the two leading candidates, pro-West Yushchenko and pro-Russia Yanukovich. Runoff elections on 21 November resulted in a standoff, with Yushchenko refusing to recognize Yanukovich as President and calling for new elections, and with Yanukovich saying that he would appoint Yushchenko Prime Minister. In September Yushchenko was treated in Vienna for a mysterious illness which paralyzed and scarred part of his face. Supporters claimed that the illness, which occurred after a meeting with the former head of the KGB, was an assassination attempt. Doctors said that they did not know the cause.",

    "summary": "New drug SR-13668 curbs AKT retroviral oncogene proteins for breast cancer. SR-16158 also treats breast cancer. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Sisters Study for breast cancer compares shared genes. Arimidex and Aromasin appear to sharply reduce breast cancer occurrence or metastasis. Oleic acid dramatically cuts expression of breast cancer precursor gene Her-2/neu and amplifies Herceptin. DNA repair deficiency strongly associates with susceptibility to breast cancer. Hypothyroidism apparently lessens chances of developing aggressive forms of breast cancer. Modern radiation therapy likely does not increase heart disease risk. Oral contraceptives likely do not increase the risk of BRAC1-associated breast cancer.The National Health Research Institute and a pharmaceutical company are testing two medications that can treat breast cancer. One drug can curb a protein active in cancer patients and the other is less likely to trigger cardiovascular disease. A new U.S. Sister Study will investigate genetic and environmental causes of breast cancer. A new drug, aromatase inhibitor, appears to sharply reduce the chances of developing cancer in the other breast. Researchers say that olive oil may help fight breast cancer. Oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups.Developmental drug SR-13668 curbs the oncogene protein AKT, prevalent in cancer patients; and SR-16158 reduces breast cancer patient heart disease risk. Aromatase inhibitors lessen breast cancer recurrence with fewer side effects than tamoxifen. Radiation therapy no longer carries heart disease risk. Olive oil suppresses oncogene Her-2/neu and boosts effectiveness of antibody Herceptin. Hypothyroidism and oral contraceptives reduce breast cancer risk. Sisters are being studied to investigate environmental and genetic affects on cancer risk. Deficiency in cell DNA repair-ability accelerates genetic changes leading to cancer. Protein markers in genes help predict cancer recurrence. Ductal lavage proved unreliable for detecting early cancer.An international group is studying an aromatose inhibitor, which may replace tamoxifin. And a Taiwanese-U.S. cooperative effort is developing a new breast-cancer drug. NIH has undertaken a study of sisters to find genetic and environmental causes of the disease. Other studies are looking into the effects and effectiveness of oral contraceptives, an underactive thyroid, olive oil, a cell's ability to repair DNA, and the flushing of milk ducts. A new Dutch diagnostic tool could help some breast-cancer patients avoid unnecessary treatment. And advances in technology and techniques have now made radiation safe for breast-cancer patients.",

    "summary": "In response to a call from the Institute of Medicine for a program against childhood obesity, there has been some action. One children's TV network introduced a Saturday afternoon message encouraging children to go out and play. Some schools have expanded physical education programs, yanked junk foods from vending machines and reduced fat in cafeteria food. At least one YMCA has introduced a fitness room designed for pre-teens. Congress has considered legislation to control advertising to children and Kraft Foods promised to stop TV advertising of certain products considered unhealthy to children under 12.To combat childhood obesity in the US, schools are removing unhealthy food from vending machines, reducing the fat in lunches, and requiring more physical education. New Hampshire is instituting twice-yearly weigh-ins for students. Children's hospitals have weight management programs and a YMCA has a kid-friendly fitness room. Efforts are being made to regulate advertising to young children. Manufacturers offer cereals low in sugar and salt with more vitamins and whole grains. US Cabinet secretaries and children's television networks are promoting healthier lifestyles for children. In New Zealand, schools added a mandatory extra hour of physical activity for students every week.Scientists say reversing childhood obesity requires wide-ranging efforts. Less time should be spent in front of the computer and television. Schools should remove junk food from vending machines and reduce the fat in cafeteria lunches. Experts recommend reducing sugar consumption. Changes need to be made in food labeling and advertising as well as more school and community recreational facilities and physical education programs. Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or who are embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids.Measures to fight childhood obesity include less time at the TV and computer, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school and community physical education programs and education to help children make better choices. The children's network Nickelodeon is encouraging children to go outside and play. They have also awarded grants to schools to expand physical play. Kraft  will stop TV ads of products unhealthy for children. New Zealand has ordered schools to ensure children take extra physical education. Schools in New Hampshire and Rhode Island have removed junk food and reduced fat in cafeteria lunches.",

    "summary": "Investigations of lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his partner Michael Scanlon by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2004 resulted in other investigations. The pair's lobbying for Indian tribes and Pacific islanders was shown to have benefitted the lobbyists and political associates while bilking the clients of millions of dollars. The House majority leader and a congressman were implicated. On Nov. 18, 2005 Michael Scanlon was charged with fraud and scheduled to go to court on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information, typically a prelude to pleading guilty and giving full cooperation with government investigators.Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal. The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas. The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio. Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal. Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.The Senate Indian Affairs Committee charged Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and fund-raiser, with running a crude extortion racket that has bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, additional congressmen and House aides are under an ethics investigation resulting from their connections with Abramoff. His activities in the Northern Marianas are also being investigated. Abramoff has been indicated in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and his partner, Michael Scanlon, was charged with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars.Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff is being investigated in connection with manipulating elections and extorting lobbying fees of $66 million from six Indian tribes related to protecting gaming franchises, and $9 million from the Northern Mariana Islands related to the textile industry. Investigations also involve Abramoff's purchase of a gambling cruise ship company and arranging unreported golf junkets to Scotland. Abramoff invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Senate hearing. Also implicated are Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his former aide Michael Scanlon, Ralph Reed, Representative Robert W. Ney, and David Safavian. Safavian was indicted in connection with a golf trip.",

    "summary": "Relief for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims continues. More than $10 billion has been pledged by 42 countries and individuals. Debt relief and loans are also being offered. Concerts, telethons, and charity auctions are among the methods being used to solicit donations. President Bush made a personal contribution of $10,000. Bush recruited Former Presidents Clinton and Bush, his father, to lead fundraising efforts in the U.S. President Bush signed a law permitting U.S. taxpayers to deduct contributions to tsunami relief in January 2005 from their 2004 returns. The Canadian government will match all private donations to approved aid agencies.Financial contributions for Asian Tsunami relief had exceeded $10 billion by Jan. 12, 2005. Governmental contributions passed $8 billion while private gifts exceeded $2 billion. The United Nations announced that it has secured aid commitments worth $717 million. Governmental contributions were led by Japan with $74m. and Germany at $68m. The outstanding organizational contributor was World Vision Australia which had raised $15.3m through a telethon. Individual contributors were led by a Canadian couple Kroum and Eva Pindoff who gave $4.1m through the Canadian Red Cross which will be matched by the Canadian government to total $8.2m.Governments have pledged over eight billion dollars in aid for countries hit by the Asian tsunami and private contributions have added over two billion dollars. Countries pledging aid include: Japan, Britain, Germany, Norway, European Commission, the US, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, China, Australia and Finland.

    "summary": "Police arrested Dennis Rader on Feb. 25, 2005 and identified him as the serial killer BTK accused of 10 killings 1974-91. BTK had taunted police with letters to them and the media, but efforts to find him failed and in 1979 the letters ceased. They resumed in March 2004 and the investigation of the BTK case reopened. Forensic experts studied DNA swabs that Kansas Governor Sibelius says linked Rader (BTK) to his victims. Little else has been revealed as to how the perpetrator of these crimes was identified and tracked down.After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas \"BTK serial killer\", Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005. He was held for 10 first-degree murders, from 1974 to 1991, but won't get Kansas's death penalty instituted in 1994. Local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI worked 31 years on 5,000 tips and evidence provided by BTK: eight letters to police and media, a victim's necklace BTK gave to his girl friend, a victim's driver's license, BTK's recorded voice and crime scene semen, thousands of DNA swabs, BTK's DNA linking to Rader, and facts matching Rader's biography.Wichita police arrested the BTK strangler during a traffic stop on February 25. Dennis Rader, serial killer of at least 10, sent numerous taunting messages and clues in the 1970's before going silent in 1979. In March 2004, he mailed evidence of a previously unattributed 1986 murder to the Wichita Eagle. More letters, clues and evidence followed. Thousands of tips poured in and police received help from forensics experts. Police long believed BTK graduated from Wichita State University, as Rader had. DNA evidence helped solve the case. Police learned of the last two BTK victims upon his arrest.Wichita police announced the identification and arrest of serial killer BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill). He is Dennis Rader, a 59-year old church leader and government inspector who police believe murdered ten people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities for their inability to catch him. Police received more than 5,000 tips when BTK resurfaced in 2004 after two decades of silence. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation. Law enforcement officials revealed nothing about the evidence they have against Rader. According to Governor Sebelius DNA evidence linked him to crime scenes.",

    "summary": "The FARC, Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla force, commits selective murders, slaughters and other terrorist acts. In 2003, FARC commandos attacked two Bogota pubs, targeting US citizens who frequented them. FARC kidnaps hundreds of people a year for ransom and holds dozens as exchangeables, including Colombian politicians, police officers, soldiers and currently three US citizens. Colombia's government is willing to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC to free rebel hostages, including the three Americans. The move is encouraged by the UN. So far FARC has not agreed to the government's terms. FARC has ordered its troops to kill Colombia's president.The Columbian Navy captured a member of the rebel group, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), who was believed to be involved in slaughtering five members of the same family. US warned US citizens in Columbia of a possible spike in \"terrorist activity.\" FARC, with about 17,000 fighters and a smaller leftist guerilla group are locked in a 40-year civil war with the government. FARC allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings. About 3,500 people are killed yearly. Columbia's president is ready to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC.The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), the largest and oldest guerilla organization in Columbia, allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings. FARC, which may have 20,000 combatants, is accused of committing murders and slaughters as well as terrorist acts in different part of Columbia. FARC kidnaps hundreds each year for ransom and holds dozens of \"exchangeables\" including politicians, police, soldiers, and three US contractors. Columbia's President Alvaro Uribe has appealed for international support in his country's war against the rebel groups. Uribe has indicated a readiness to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC.Colombian President Pastrana held talks with FARC and designated a safe haven until FARC hijacked an airliner and kidnapped a senator. In 2003 FARC bombed American-frequented pubs and abducted three Americans after a plane crash. In 2004 FARC killed five members of a Colombian family and bombed a peasant home, killing one. The US designated FARC a terrorist organization and aided Colombia financially in its anti-FARC war. President Uribe offered to swap 50 jailed rebels for 50 hostages. FARC-government fighting kills 3,500 yearly. A FARC bomb narrowly missed Uribe in 2002. Uribe is pursuing an aggressive military offensive against FARC.",

Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham insisted there was nothing wrong with his living on a yacht owned by the executive of MZM, Inc. for which he had helped gain government contracts or selling a San Diego home for $1,675,000 to the executive who resold it for $975,000. On July 1 federal agents raided Cunningham's San Diego residence and the MZM offices and yacht in Washington. Cunningham soon announced that he would not seek reelection and the executive stepped down. On August 13 Cunningham asked donors for permission to use their campaign contributions for legal expenses.By July 2005 U.S. Representative Randall Cunningham was under investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the IRS and a federal grand jury probe. He received defense contractor MZM Inc's PAC money and personal donations from MZM President, Mitchell Wade. Wade paid a supposedly inflated price for Cunningham's and Cunningham paid Wade questionably little money to live on Wade's yacht in DC. Cunningham promoted MZM defense contracts, contributed to and served on a Wade-run charity board, and spoke at an MZM company party. Cunningham requested donors' permission to transfer campaign funds to his legal defense fund.The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating Rep. Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor, Mitchell Wade, for an inflated price. Agencies are probing Wade's efforts to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts. Cunningham was living on Wade's yacht, which has also raised questions about improper financial links. He defended his boat arrangement as proper saying that he paid fees and services in lieu of rent. Cunningham is asking his contributors, including Wade, for permission to use their campaign donations for his legal defense.Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-California, is a favorite of defense contractors who contribute heavily to his political campaign. The CEO of one company, MZM, Mitchell Wade, contributes to Cunningham's campaign and PAC, but  supports the congressman in other ways. When in Washington, Cunningham lives aboard Wade's yacht docked at a Potomac River yacht club and pays only docking fees. Wade purchased Cunningham's home in San Diego for over  $1.6M and a few months later sold it for a $700,000 loss suggesting that Cunningham was paid an inflated price. After that sale, Cunningham bought another home for over $2.5M.",

The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from the US, UK, Sweden. Bulgaria and Germany for a slot on its unmanned moon mission, Chandrayaan-1. The European Space Agency and NASA will have x-ray and laser equipment on the satellite. The ISRO will provide satellite connectivity to the Jharkhand Space Application Center for a telemedicine system to connect villagers with doctors at renowned hospitals. This network will also function in Afghanistan.The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and France will cooperate on a satellite to track tropical atmospheric conditions. ISRO has short-listed experiments from five nations (US, UK, Sweden, Bulgaria, Germany) for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission, Chandrayaan-1, which is to map the lunar surface. India can send a man into space within seven years. Its first astronaut flew on the Soviet Salyut 7 in 1984. Another died in the Columbia shuttle disaster. India plans a telemedicine system to connect hospitals and patients via satellite. India plans flight-testing of its cryogenic rocket. It sought black-market electrical components for rockets.India's space program is developing on several fronts. India is planning an unmanned moon mission to map the moon's surface and produce a chemical map of the moon. Experiments from five countries (the U.S. and four European nations) are short-listed for this satellite. It has an agreement with France to launch a satelite perhaps in 2008 to make climate predictions more accurate. It will set up a telemedicine system, linking doctors at the best hospitals with patients across India. Afghanistan has asked India for help setting up a similar program in Afghanistan using Indian satellites.",

    "summary": "In October, 2004, the Dover, PA School Board ordered that biology students be told evolution \"is a theory, not a fact\" and \"intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs\" from evolution, and encouraged to read \"Of Pandas & People\", added to the school library. Trial began September, 26, 2005. Plaintiffs argued intelligent design is not scientific, but religious; that board members had religious motivation; and that intelligent design and \"Pandas\" are recast creationism which has been banned from public school science classes by the Supreme Court as a violation of the first amendment's establishment clause.The Dover, Pennsylvania school board passed a resolution in October 2004 requiring 9th grade biology students be told that evolution is a theory, not a fact, and that intelligent design is an alternative explanation of the origin of life. The board is being sued by 11 parents of students who charge it is trying to promote a religion in violation of the US Constitution. The school board argues it is informing students about differences of opinion, not endorsing any religious view. The trial is underway.Pennsylvania's Dover School Board voted requiring teachers to read a brief statement about intelligent design to students before teaching classes on evolution. Intelligent design implies that nature is so complex it must be the work of a single creator rather than evolution. The school board stated that intelligent design provides an alternative to teaching evolution and denies that it is \"religion in disguise.\" Dover parents brought suit against the school board charging that teaching \"intelligent design\" is a clear violation of the principle of separation of church and state.The Dover, Pennsylvania, school board passed a resolution requiring students in a 9th grade biology course be told evolution \"is a theory, not a fact\" and \"intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs\" from evolution. Board members who voted 6-3 for the measure made it clear they believed the origin of life was guided by a heavenly hand. Eleven Dover families are suing the school district alleging the policy violates the constitutional separation of church and state.

    "summary": "Steroid use appears rampant in Major League Baseball based on former player revelations and the BALCO steroid distribution scandal. Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena. The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient. Baseball executives and players union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for the current season.Major League Baseball players Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco admitted taking steroids. Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez are accused or suspected of steroid use. Caminiti claimed half the players used them. 5-7 percent of players tested positive in 2003 and 1-2 percent in 2005. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig investigated steroid use in 1998 and urged banning over-the-counter sales. A pamphlet in English and Spanish on steroids' effects was distributed to players. Drug tests for players began in 2004. Some steroids became controlled substances. Congress held hearings on baseball steroid use.",

    "summary": "Bamboo shoots must be properly prepared to avoid consuming naturally produced hydrogen cyanide. Bamboo can help makeshift buildings better withstand earthquakes. Innovative bamboo products include: hardwood flooring, paneling, cabinets, countertops, utensils, plates, bowls, cutting boards, shower curtains, and products based on fiber, fiber pulps or veneers. Bamboo's has greater tensile strength than steel. It can be harvested every 3 to 5 years, but entire bamboo stands die-off every 60 years, threatening crop collapse and endangering China's endangered Giant Pandas, who are dependent on arrow bamboo.Bamboo has many uses. In the home, it is used for flooring, kitchen cabinets, counter tops, and chairs. India is allowing its islands that were struck by the tsunami, to build makeshift houses from bamboo and other woods, which can withstand quakes. Ethiopia hopes to optimize ways of producing bamboo to reduce poverty. Large areas of arrow bamboo provide food for giant pandas in northwest China. Now they are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo died. It takes 10-15 years for new plants to grow.Bamboo is increasing used for household items and furniture. Its main use remains as a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring. It has greater tensile strength than steel and costs less and lasts longer than oak flooring. It is environmentally friendly and sustainable since it grows fast and can be harvested within five years. Bamboo shoots are a traditional part of Asian cuisine but must be properly prepared to avoid causing harm. The bamboo plant is the staple panda food. But when the plant flowers and produces seeds, pandas will not eat it and are in danger of starving.Bamboo is used for flooring, paneling, and furnishings. Its tensile strength is greater than steel, it's harvestable in 3-5 years, and it's inexpensive. India makes bamboo housing for earthquake survivors. Ethiopia is developing its extensive bamboo commercially with China's help. A pulp mill for bamboo-like Arundo donax would benefit Alabama economically but residents fear the plant's invasiveness. California imported it for windbreaks. Giant pandas are increasing in China due to expanded bamboo forests and moving pandas when local bamboo flowers and becomes inedible. KFC in China substitutes bamboo shoots for coleslaw. Incorrect preparation of fresh shoots risks hydrogen cyanide exposure.",

    "summary": "Cell-phone driving laws are having limited success in passage. Federal bills died in committee. Without a national consensus, existing state and local government laws vary widely. Drivers either ignore or are unaware of existing laws. Enforcement is not uniform. Lobbyists oppose legislation and argue driver distraction by various factors is at fault not cell-phone technology. A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that there is little difference between hand-held and hands-free device driver distraction. The survey confirms that cell-phone use while driving increases injuries and deaths.The District of Columbia, New York and New Jersey passed legislation that bans using hand-held cell phones while driving. More than 400,000 tickets and warnings have been issued since New York first enacted this law. New Mexico and Chicago City only allow hands-free cell phone. Texas is considering cell phone laws. An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety survey said using any cell phones while driving is dangerous. Drivers using cell phones are four times as likely to end up in a crash as drivers who didn't use a cell phone.Forty-five countries banned hand-held phone use while driving. In the US only New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia completely ban hand-held phone use. Some states direct hand-held bans to specific groups such as school bus drivers or those on learner's permits. Some municipalities have enacted bans but some have been overturned by states declining to take action against cell phone use. Some jurisdictions permit hands-free cell phone use. Cell phone bills in Texas and California failed to carry. Laws are often ignored and enforcement spotty. However, Washington police average 600 tickets and 250 warnings each month.The District of Columbia, NY state, New Jersey, Connecticut and Chicago ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states or cities ban use with learner's permits, by school bus drivers, by minors for six months after getting their licenses, or require hands-free phones. Every state has considered restrictions but bills seldom pass. Some states, including Florida, prohibit local governments from restricting cell phone use. Hands-free and hand-held cell phones are equally distracting. Laws are often ignored. Enforcement is spotty. Hand-held phone use while driving is banned in 45 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Britain and Japan.",

    "summary": "In August 2003, former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, accepted asylum in Nigeria from 17 counts of war crimes in Sierra Leone. He has been accused of violating the asylum agreement by harboring Al-Qaeda terrorists, interfering with Liberian presidential elections and an assassination attempt on the Guinea President. The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea. In March 2006 the new Liberian president requested Taylor be released to Sierra Leone vice Liberia. President Bush and Obasanjo were to discuss Taylor on March 29.Former Liberian President Charles Taylor fled to Nigeria in August 2003 and is under house arrest at a riverside villa in Calabar. Taylor regularly defies restrictions against travel, political activity or media contact. He is actively trying to destabilize West Africa, spending money he looted from Liberia. Taylor meddles in Liberian affairs, harbors members of Al-Qaeda, and ordered an assassination attempt against Guinea's President Conte. Nigerian President Obasanjo agreed to turn Taylor over to Liberia but is pressured to send him to war crimes court in Sierra Leone where Taylor is under indictment for crimes against humanity while backing rebels.",

    "summary": "Electric power networks are vulnerable to physical attacks (conventional explosives or nuclear electromagnetic pulse) and computer attacks (external or internal) against the internet-based supervisory control and data acquisition computers and networks that remotely control power generation and transmission. Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced. Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent. Terrorist attacks are being simulated using computer models. The 2005 Energy Bill calls for increased energy production and grid modernization.",

    "summary": "By April 2005 the cause of legalizing gay marriage was making remarkable headway in Europe and Canada, edging slowly ahead in sections of the U.S. and facing aggressive opposition in some other states. Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland had legalized the practice. In Canada 7 of the 10 provinces and one of three territories accepted gay marriage. In the U. S. eighteen states had passed constitutional amendments prohibiting it while Massachusetts allows and three New England states, New Jersey, California and Hawaii had taken steps toward allowing it.Spain joined Belgium and the Netherlands as the only European countries to legalize homosexual marriages. In the US, a judge threw out an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution banning gay marriage. Massachusetts legalized gay marriage in May. Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Utah have all passed constitutional bans on gay marriage. A US judge ruled that California state law effectively bans gay marriage as unconstitutional. Over half of Canada's 10 provinces and tree territories allow same-sex marriage.Homosexual marriages were legalized in Spain including the right to adopt. Some European countries have passed legislation authorizing gay marriages, but not all give gay couples the right to adopt. Poland's senate approved draft bill allowing same-sex partnerships. In Canada, seven provinces authorized gay marriages. In the U.S., gay marriages are banned in 18 states. Massachusetts legalized gay marriages and Vermont's law applies to civil unions. Judges in California and New York ruled state laws banning gay marriages were unconstitutional.The Netherlands and Belgium allow gay marriage. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland and France give gay couples the same legal rights as married heterosexual couples. Spain approved a bill to legalize homosexual marriages. Poland's upper house approved legal partnership rights. Massachusetts allows homosexual marriage. Vermont and Connecticut allow civil unions. Judges in Louisiana and California declared state bans on gay marriage unconstitutional. Eighteen states including Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah ban same-sex marriage. Saskatchewan became the seventh Canadian province to allow gay marriage. The Roman Catholic Church opposes gay marriage.",

    "summary": "Three pipeline projects underway to transport natural gas from Asia to Europe are raising political and unspecified environmental concerns. A northern pipeline delivers gas to Germany, France and England. A central one connects Turkey to Romania, Bulgaria and Austria. The southern one supplies Greece and Italy from Turkey. The pipeline to Germany circumvents the concept of a common European policy with Russia. Russia has a monopoly agreement on gas exported from Kazakhstan produced in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russia's actions are viewed as applying political pressure on neighboring countries. The pipelines are expected to begin operating between 2007 and 2010.Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas group and the German company BASF plan a Baltic Sea pipeline to transport Russian gas directly to Europe. The pipeline will be launched in 2010, three years from the original estimate. It will make landfall in northern Germany then continue to the Netherlands and across the English Channel. Austria and Bulgaria plan a gas pipeline from Turkey through Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to Austria. Construction is to begin on a Turkey-Greece pipeline to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe. An underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy is part of the plan.Russia's Gazprom will control the Northern European Gas Pipeline, bringing Siberian gas directly to Europe. It will bypass Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, who fear being cut off from Russian gas. Gazprom and Germany's BASF will build it. Gerhard Schroeder, criticized for profiting from a project he supported while German chancellor, will chair the board. Gazprom arranged a monopoly on gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Kazakhstan. The Austria-Bulgaria \"Nabucco\" project is a gas pipeline from Turkey to Austria. A Southern Europe Gas Ring from Turkey through Greece and across the Ionian Sea to Italy is to be completed by 2006.The Northern European Gas Pipeline, which will bring gas from Northern Siberia through Russia and under the Baltic Sea to northern Germany, then to the Netherlands and under the English Channel to Britain. Poland, the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine are critical of the pipeline, because it bypasses current transit routes through those countries. The Southern Europe Gas Ring project is to transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea area and Central Asia through Turkey and Greece then under the Ionian Sea to Italy. Construction of the Turkey-Greece segment is scheduled to start in July 2005.",

    "summary": "President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court caused much consternation. The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire \"inadequate,\" \"insufficient,\" and \"insulting.\"President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses \"inadequate\" and \"insulting\" and asked her to redo it.",

    "summary": "The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), thought extinct since 1944, was seen again February 11, 2004 near where it was last seen in the \"Big Woods\" region of eastern Arkansas. Several independent sightings and video by teams from the Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, ruled out the similar pileated woodpecker and confirmed the rediscovery, which was kept secret for over a year to prepare to protect the bird's habitat not least from a flood of bird watchers, for which private groups, including The Nature Conservancy spent about $10 million, and the Interior Department committed over $10 million.The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years. The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker. There have been 15 sightings captured on video although researchers can't determine how many were seen. The government proposed $10 million for efforts to protect the bird. Private groups will contribute another $10 million.The ivory-billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed. There have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during more than 7,000 hours searching.The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp. Its existence has been confirmed by at least 8 sightings, a 4-second video, and its distinctive \"double-knock\" drumming. The first sighting was in February 2004 but was kept secret for over a year while experts confirmed the discovery and protected the bird's territory. Private groups and individuals have raised $10 million for protection of the woodpecker and its environment, while the federal government has proposed $10 million in federal funds.

    "summary": "Prior to parliamentary elections on Feb. 27, 2005 about 300 opposition activists gathered in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek demonstrating in favor of democratic elections and calling for President Askar Akayev to step down at the end of his second term in October. The administration staged a counter-demonstration. After Akayev won overwhelming election victories the opposition charged the government with mass election violations, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and held a regional governor and a district chief hostage. Akayev ordered investigation and negotiations and fired the interior minister and prosecutor general while police dispersed crowds in Bishkek.In February 2005 rallies in Bishkek urged President Akayev to step down as promised and constitutionally required after October presidential elections, fearing a referendum to continue his reign. Akayev supporters won a landslide parliamentary victory. Opposition leaders and the European Organization for Security and Cooperation charged the elections were flawed. By March 16 opposition forces rallied, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, demanded Akayev's resignation, and took hostage a regional governor and district chief. On March 20 four policemen were beaten after police fired shots at demonstrators. Akayev ordered investigations into election fraud charges and fired the interior minister and prosecutor-general.Kyrgyz oppositionists, fearing President Akayev might hold onto power longer than his constitutional two terms, rallied and urged him to step down. He refused, saying elections were fair, opposition leaders were unnecessarily inciting civil war, and talks were the solution to the crisis. The opposition refused to accept a landslide victory by Akayev supporters in parliamentary elections and claimed fraud. They blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and took a governor and district chief hostage. When police fired shots to dispel rioters, crowds beat four policemen to death. Akayev ordered fraud claims investigated and replaced the interior minister and prosecutor-general.Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 27 February, with presidential elections planned for October. Akayev supporters won a landslide victory in most areas, but both opposition leaders and western observers cited mass violations. Run-off parliamentary elections were held in many regions on 13 March. The opposition was defeated but refused to accept the results and demanded Akayev's resignation. Even before the election, opposition leaders had been calling for Akayev to step down as President at the end of October in accordance with the constitution. But Akayev refused to resign or to annul the election results.",

    "summary": "Prominent award-winning Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk was indicted for insulting the Turkish identity by comments he made to a Swiss reporter about one million Armenians massacred in Turkey during World War I. He could face up to three years in prison. The US and EU called on Turkey to drop the charges. His December 16 trial was suspended until February 7 because the court lacked a justice ministry order to proceed. The case has stirred outrage across Europe. EU officials were there to observe the trial, the outcome of which could damage the Turkey's chances of joining the EU.Prominent Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk, was indicted over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres. Pamuk is charged under Turkey's penal code which carries a jail term of more than three years for a person who \"explicitly insults\" the Turkish republic. The European Union (EU) warned Turkey that its prosecution of Pamuk could damage its chance of joining the EU and is a test of Turkey's commitment to freedom of expression and reforms in its law. European countries, U.S. and activist organizations have criticized Turkey's lack of democratic principles and citizen's rights.In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage. He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for \"public denigration of the Turkish identity,\" carrying up to 3 years in jail. Turkey says the deaths were fewer and from civil unrest, not genocide. The US, European Union, and activist organizations criticized Turkey's criminal charges for freedom of expression. The EU said Pamuk's trial would affect Turkey's EU bid. A Turkish court ruled Pamuk should be tried under old laws requiring justice ministry direct order and postponed the trial.Orhan Pamuk went to court on 16 December for outspoken comments made during a Swiss newspaper interview about the Armenian massacres. The EU warned that the trial could affect Turkey's EU accession process because it would indicate the strength of Turkey's commitment to recent reforms guaranteeing freedom of expression. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said, \"It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial, but Turkey.\" The trial was suspended until 7 February pending a decision from the Justice Ministry. The offense had been made before the new penal code had gone into effect and therefore came under the old law.",
