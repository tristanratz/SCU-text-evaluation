        "20": "\"There is no room for complacency\".\nThe study, by scientists from the universities of Durham, Edinburgh and from the British Antarctic Survey, or BAS, said the George VI Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula is the first to show that a currently 'healthy' ice shelf experienced an extensive retreat about 9,500 years ago, more than anything seen in recent years.\n\"What this tells us is that ice shelves don't just break up because they get too big _ as the global warning skeptics argue,\" said Dominic Hodgson, a scientist with the British Antarctic Survey and one of the leading investigators.\n",
        "16": "The information being gathered here coincides with the recent publication of a report on accelerating climate change in the Arctic, an area that has been far more scrutinized than Antarctica.\nThat study, commissioned by the United States and seven other nations, found permafrost there to be thawing and glaciers and sea ice to be retreating markedly, raising new concerns about global warming and its impact.\nCasassa, Thomas and colleagues have watched the back door since the early 1990s, most recently via satellite tracking.\nThey reported in the journal Science last September that a half-dozen glaciers there are now thinning and\n",

        "9": "In the Antarctic, only 1 percent is melting,.\nBut let's hold our horses because it's not everywhere that the ice is melting.\nThat's because the bright white ice tends to reflect more of the sun's radiation.\nFor example, the white sea ice reflects solar radiation back into space, but as the ice melts the dark water will absorb some of the light, warming and melting more ice.\nThere are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in just decades because of global warming.\nWe could be underestimating the rate of global temperature increase.\n",

        "6": "The hypotheses scientists offer for the causes of glacier and ice shelf thinning in Antarctica are varied.\nIn 1995 the Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated, followed in 1998 by the collapse of the nearby Wilkins ice shelf.\nThe narrow peninsula contains relatively little inland ice.\nThe melting ice may affect polar bears, and whales.\nZhang Zhanhai, director of Polar Research Institute of China, said that the melting rate of Arctic ice is\"alarming\".\nThe current retreat of ice shelves in the Antarctic due to global warming is nothing new--but this time the problem is manmade and therefore potentially more serious.\n",
