        "summary": "  The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.    Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.    The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.    In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise. ",

Airbus raised the price to approximately $292 million. A wing failure during testing may delay the A380's safety certification. The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. 33 were injured in an emergency evacuation drill. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. Airbus plans to deliver the first two jets to Singapore Airlines by the end of 2006.    By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. The first A380 delivery (to Singapore) slid from early to late 2006. With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries. By 2006 20 airports will be A380-ready; 38 by 2008; 60 by 2010.    The A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, an important component toward the super jumbo's official certification for commercial flights. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380. Production problems rather than safety or quality issues have caused the delays. Airbus has 159 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients. The US is studying the potential for turbulence generated by the A380 reflecting safety precautions.      In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. Customized cabins and entertainment system installation problems caused delays. France called unreasonable a US-proposed safety review to determine whether A380 turbulence would require greater distances around the plane. Airbus raised the A380's price by $10 million. A wing ruptured during a February 2006 stress test but the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification. Airbus was approaching its break-even point of 250 plane sales. Twenty airports would be ready for A380s in 2006, with Singapore Airlines being first to fly the plane.  ",

        "summary": "  Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.    Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.    In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.    The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate. ",

Kyoto Protocol, which commits 39 nations to reduce greenhouse gases, is not enough. Infrastructure in Russia is being damaged due to the melting permafrost including airports, gas pipelines and railways. Wildlife including polar bears, reindeer, seals, and fish are threatened as well as many plant species. Fishing zones are disappearing. Shipping lanes are at risk. The Arctic and Antarctic of today will be radically changed within the next century if action is not taken worldwide.    Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears. Less ice reflects less sunlight, warming the planet, leading to more ice melt and sea-level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100. Greenland's ice fishing season has shortened. Lake areas doubled. Glaciers Sermeg, Sermilik, and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster. Alaska's Columbia glacier also melted faster.    Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. If this occurs, considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere, which could amplify global warming. However, another researcher disagrees that the thaw would be so large. He states that Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.     Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change. There continues to be disagreement on whether or not this is the effect of human activity, although scientists agree that something has changed radically and that there are few other explanations. New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply. And two explorers working with Greenpeace could not complete a trip from Siberia to the North Pole because of the effects of rising temperatures, including broken ice, strong currents, and heavy rainfall.

The mining industry is riddled with corruption from mining officials to owners. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production. South Africa recently provided China with information on mining safety and technology during a conference. China is beginning enforcement of safety regulations. Over 12,000 mines have been ordered to suspend operations and 4,000 others ordered closed. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. China's mines are the most dangerous worldwide.    Chinese coalmines are said to be the most dangerous in the world.  January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004.  Accidents included explosions, floods and cave-ins.  The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.    China's accident-plagued coal mines cause thousands of deaths and injuries annually. 2004 saw over 6,000 mine deaths. January through August 2005, deaths rose 8.5% over the same period in 2004. Most accidents are gas explosions, but fires, floods, and cave-ins also occur. Ignored safety procedures, outdated equipment, and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem. Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill-managed and illegally-run mines, punishing errant owners, issuing new safety regulations and measures, and outlawing local officials from investing in mines. China also sought solutions at the Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held in Beijing.

Automatic gas monitors were installed in 22 gas-rich coal mines. China fired two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and fired or demoted 126 more after accident investigations. China has created a whistleblowers fund to reward citizens reporting negligence and illegal mine investors. Mine safety remains a major challenge as coal represents 67% of China's energy resource.    Government officials have announced that 4,000 small coalmines will be closed by the end of 2005.  One city in north China has imposed huge fines on coalmines for each death in accidents.

In December 2005 the government announced that it had dismissed two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and demoted or dismissed 126 other officials blamed for accidents killing 528 people.  Despite such measures the rate of large-scale accidents increases with accidents reported on a near-daily basis.    Accident and death rates continue to increase at China's provincial coal mines, while rates decrease at state-owned facilities.

Emergency responders are voluntarily assisting but humane societies are requesting a policy that local, state and federal responders will diligently assist with pet rescues. Representatives Lantos and Oberstar are co-sponsoring the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act to force local and state governments to create emergency evacuation plans for pets or forfeit FEMA disaster grant eligibility. Rescued animals are being fostered in prisons and other states as local shelters are overwhelmed. Unprecedented millions of dollars are being donated for pet rescue effort.    Rescue efforts continue for pets abandoned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Some are still found alive, but estimated tens of thousands have already died. By 10 October, some 8,000 animals have been rescued. At least 600 have been reunited with their owners. Tens of millions of dollars have been donated for Katrina animal rescue. Animals have been sent from the Lamar-Dixon shelter and another at Louisiana State University to smaller shelters, foster homes and even prisons across the country to await reunions or adoption. Lamar-Dixon will be shut down on 15 October. Petfinder.com will list pets through 15 December.    Five thousand pets have been rescued but time is running out for the rest. Many animals are sick from consuming contaminated water, garbage and carrion. LSU's Parker Coliseum (Baton Rouge) houses over a thousand rescued pets and Lamar-Dixon expo center (Gonzales) holds up to 2,000, including larger and sicker animals. Staff are from the Humane Society, US Public Health Service, FEMA, and volunteers. Pets are sent to smaller shelters, foster homes, and prisons for longer-term care. Over 600 have been reunited with owners. Rescuing people takes priority but the Humane Society and a bill in Congress urge pet evacuation also.    Tens of millions of dollars have been donated to pet charities because of Hurricane Katrina, but weeks after the storm, abandoned animals are still a major concern. It is estimated that more than 50,000 pets were left behind. Hundreds arrive at shelters every day, most suffering from at least one ailment, such as dysentery, infection, malnutrition, dehydration. Many died before they could be rescued. Local shelters are overwhelmed, so some animals are being sent to shelters and foster homes in other states. Two prisons have taken in animals, which the inmates will care for until permanent homes can be found. ",

The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.    Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.    Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit. Seniors choosing a Medicare Part D-approved private drug insurance plan risk loosing their other medical insurance. Employers used Part D federal subsidies to reduce retirees' overall health premiums; others dropped retiree health plans entirely. Of 40 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 28 million will enter Part D.    Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit, which becomes effective January 1, 2006, through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA). If a senior purchases a Part D plan, any prior drug benefit will be voided. The government will not negotiate prices or discounts under the plan. Employers who offer drug coverage to those over 65 are required to provide comparisons of their plan and Part D. Medicare has a hotline and Web site to help people confused by Part D. ",

The Medicare website has been so inundated with traffic that it is extremely slow or jammed thus adding to the frustration and anger of enrollees seeking information independently. Due to the extensive criticism of the plan, some lawmakers are seeking a two-year delay in its implementation. Computer savvy children of seniors are just as confused and baffled over plan details as their parents.    Calls for help have increased sharply since enrollment for Medicare Part D opened. Many organizations and volunteers try to supplement the swamped Medicare lines, but all face developing backlogs and problems training personnel. The multiplicity of options, deductibles, premiums and exceptions make comparisons overwhelming if not impossible. Some lawmakers are suggesting a two-year delay in implementation of the plan. One week into open application, The New York Times declared Part D as an attempt to do something about drug costs for seniors and at the same time protect drug and insurance companies. &quot;It's a mess. It's hopelessly confusing.&quot;    Seniors are daunted by comparing their current coverage with Part D, baffled by hundreds of complex options, and fearful of picking the wrong Part D plan with wide-ranging premiums and unpredictable coverage changes, potentially costing them several thousands of dollars more annually. Only 6% of Medicare beneficiaries visited the balky web-based Part D plan selection tool. Many drug companies will stop offering free or subsidized promotional drugs to needy seniors. Increased competition among Part D private providers lowered some premiums, but a Senate report showed Part D drug prices are 3% higher than CostCo and Drugstore.com; 60% higher than Canada.    The Plan D's intricacies and implementation have been so criticized that some lawmakers a pushing for a two-year delay. Various consumer advocacy groups will assist Medicare enrollees in understanding Plan D. A Medicare spokesman said that the agency updated the plans and prices every Monday and that an enrollee could change plans every day until the end of 2005. When the program starts on January 1st, the enrollee will be paying the rate quoted at enrollment time.

        "summary": "  The 7 year legal battles between the husband and parents of Florida resident Terri Schiavo over whether to extend her life artificially continue with day to day countermanding legal rulings including Florida's Supreme Court. Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, intervened for the parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused involvement. State rulings for the husband ordered the immediate removal of Shiavo's feeding tube. The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.      Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.    Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed &quot;Terri's law&quot; through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.    The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President. As of 19 March the feeding tube had been removed by court order. ",

Schiavo's parents hope to override state rulings and have their daughter's feeding tube reinserted. Federal judges refused to reverse the Florida court's ruling. Florida lawmakers refused to re-enter the case after the federal ruling. A Florida court will hear new motions per Governor Bush. However the parents' appeals for reinsertion of the feeding tube were denied. After prolonged legal debates including unprecedented Congressional intervention and five U.S. Supreme Court appeals, Terri Schiavo died 18 days after her feeding tube was removed.    Terri Schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tube was removed by order of a Florida state court judge. Her parents continued to fight to keep their daughter alive. A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted. President Bush signed an unprecedented law to avert her death. Florida lawmakers refused to intervene in her case. An appeals court and US Circuit court also ruled against her family. The US Supreme court turned aside the case of Terri Schiavo.    Michael Schiavo won a malpractice suit concerning Terri's coma in 1993. He first petitioned for feeding tube removal in 1998. After final tube removal in 2005, US District Court Judge James Whittemore refused to order reinsertion. The parents appealed to a three-judge federal appeals panel but were rebuffed. Judge Greer issued an injunction keeping the DCF and police away from Terri. Courts consistently rejected appeals related to abuse allegations or new medical diagnoses, and efforts to block Terri's cremation. The US Supreme Court again declined involvement. A federal appeals court agreed to consider a new hearing but Terri died first.    Terri Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March, thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed by court order. Her husband has requested an autopsy. In the final two weeks of Schiavo's life, at least 47 protestors were arrested and there were numerous appeals to have the tube reinserted. Efforts even included a congressional bill to shift jurisdiction from state to federal courts and President Bush's rush back from Texas to sign that bill. In Florida Governor Bush tried to get custody transferred to the Florida government. And the case bounced back and forth in state and federal courts. ",

Libby's lawyers seek dismissal of charges against him saying that Fitzgerald did not have the legal authority to indict Libby. By court order, edited government documents related to intelligence briefings will be provided to Libby for his defense. Fitzgerald opposed the request to dismiss the case saying he had the legal authority to indict.    After Libby's indictment, reporter Bob Woodward told Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald that about one month before Valerie Plame's identity was exposed, he had learned it from another Bush administration official (not Libby). Karl Rove revealed Plame's identify to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper days before Libby revealed it to columnist Robert Novak. Portions of the Plame identity leak investigation's grand jury testimony were unsealed. Libby had told the grand jury that Vice President Cheney had authorized him to leak classified information. Fitzgerald disputed Libby's motion to a federal judge to dismiss his indictment, claiming the Prosecutor was appointed unconstitutionally.     Washington Post editor Bob Woodward acknowledged that a senior WH official, other than Scooter Libby, had told him Plame was a CIA operative before it was reported by Novak. Plame resigned from the CIA since her outing diminished her career possibilities. Karl Rove remains under investigation; he disclosed that he had told a Time magazine reporter of Plame's CIA status. Libby's attorneys continue to argue for dismissal of the case against him. It was reported that Libby will argue that Chaney authorized him to leak classified information to bolster the case for war against Iraq.    Libby's lawyers have asked a federal judge to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the prosecutor lacked the legal authority to indict Libby. The Special Counsel disputes that claim. Libby's trial has been set for January 2007. He is expected to testify that he was too involved with national security issues to recall minor events such as conversations with reporters. A federal judge has ordered the government to provide Libby with redacted versions of various documents and other information he requested.

By January 2005 the Christian minority was organized into political parties in preparation for the January 30th parliamentary elections. On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.    Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004.

Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.    Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors.

On Dec. 15 the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie had indeed violated accounting rules. Lawmakers called for return of millions in executive bonuses.

Those charges stemmed from alleged fraudulent accounting practices dating back to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of AOL's audit committee.    Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae is defending its accounting practices and disagrees with allegations that it violated rules to maximize executive bonuses. Fannie Mae will be investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faces litigation by shareholders. Raines and other executives could not only lose their jobs, but also face fines and prison for knowingly certifying false financial statements. They can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from sale of stock.    Major concerns have arisen over the leadership and credibility of Fannie Mae's CEO Franklin Raines. The regulatory agency known as OFHEO conducted the Initial investigations into Fannie Mae's accounting practices and found that the company had violated accounting rules to present a picture of financial well-being and to maximize executive bonuses. Raines has had to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation. The SEC has opened an inquiry into company accounting practices. The U.S. attorney's office is pursuing a criminal investigation. And eight lawsuits have been filed on behalf of shareholders. ",

There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.      Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.    The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of &quot;planet.&quot; Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight &quot;inner&quot; planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.     Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. &quot;Planet&quot; has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.  ",

However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument. Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue. The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces. Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313. The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.    A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena). Both might be called &quot;minor planets&quot; or could be considered KBOs. NASA's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto's claim to planethood by finding its second and perhaps third moon. On Jan 20, 2006 NASA launched its New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt which it is scheduled to reach in July 2015. Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto's 1380. The IAU committee continues to deliberate.    Debate continues over what constitutes a planet. Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers (both Pluto and UB313 do). Another suggestion is roundness: this would include these two and likely several others yet unknown. Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate its surroundings, which would exclude Pluto and UB313. Pluto became more interesting when the Hubble telescope discoverd that Pluto had not just one but three moons. Scientific interest in Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission: a nine year trip to Pluto and beyond.     Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term. KBO 2003 UB313, discovered by Michael E. Brown, was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto. Both have surface methane ice. If Pluto is a planet, 2003 UB313 should be too. The Hubble Space Telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto, 30-100 miles in diameter. Pluto and its large moon Charon, close physically and in size, may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between them. At least four KBOs have known moons. Pluto would be the first KBO to have multiple satellites.  ",

        "summary": "  Christine A. Gregoire was sworn in as the new governor on Jan. 12, 2005. In the first action on Dino Rossi's lawsuit to oust Gregoire the Judge declared that his courtroom and not the Democratic-controlled legislature was the proper forum to investigate the election. The case was scheduled to go to trial May 23. Although Democrats acknowledged human errors in vote counting, they vigorously denied Republican charges of fraud. The lawsuit was dismissed on June 6 for lack of evidence and Rossi did not appeal to the Supreme Court.    Christine Gregoire's inauguration as Washington's governor occurred amid a legal challenge by Republican candidate Rossi. Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that his court rather than the state legislature would investigate the election. The judge ruled that before ordering a new election or declaring Rossi the winner, Republicans would need to prove Rossi received more votes than Gregoire after supposed illegal votes were deducted. Bridges noted that the only proven illegal votes had been for Rossi. Five months after the inauguration, Judge Bridges dismissed the Republican lawsuit. After that ruling, Rossi ended his legal effort to remove Gregoire.    Gregoire was sworn in as governor and proceeded to govern as if elected by landslide, imposing taxes and improving roads. Rossi sued for a revote in Republican-leaning, rural Chelan County, claiming illegal votes by felons and ballot-box stuffing. Most Washingtonians opposed a revote. Constitutional language on contested races was ambiguous. Judge John E. Bridges heard the case without a jury. He dismissed the lawsuit because Rossi's lawyers failed to meet their burden of proof. Most of the proved illegal votes by felons were for Rossi. Rossi ended his efforts to remove Gregoire, who was certified as governor-elect in June 2005.    Democrat Christine Gregoire was sworn in as governor of Washington state on 12 January after an extremely close election. The Republicans sued to overturn the gubernatorial election, charging election fraud. A judge dismissed the lawsuit on 6 June, asserting that there were human errors but no fraud, and Republican Dino Rossi decided to end his 5-month legal fight. Gregoire was declared the winner in late June by the Washington Secretary of State. Meanwhile, by the end of the month Rossi vowed to continue his fight and called for a new vote. ",

Talks between Darfur rebels and the Sudanese government were held in Abuja, Nigeria in August and September 2004.

Originally set for Sirte, Libya, the meeting was later shifted to Tripoli. Earlier talks had been held in Abuja in August and September. The Sudanese Liberation Army would not attend the Libyan meeting. British PM Tony Blair planned to meet in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian President and current AU chairman Olusegun Obasanjo.

The rebels vowed never to resume the negotiation process unless the government ends its attacks and withdraws from the troubled area. Peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebel groups have been suspended until January 2005.    The Sudanese government and the People's Liberation Movement promised to conclude two years of talks, now in Naivasha, with a peace accord.

Democrats are threatening filibusters to block her confirmation because her judicial views are considered extreme. The Senate Judiciary Committee engaged in angry debates. Republicans are threatening the 'nuclear option' as a means to end any filibusters. Republicans dismissed a Democratic proposal because it did not include the removal of filibusters. Additional compromise talks ended unsuccessfully. A new proposed agreement would allow Democrats to filibuster only in extreme circumstances. A new confirmation vote date has not been determined.    On April 21, 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to revive the long dormant nomination of Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Brown's nomination had been blocked by Democratic filibuster during President Bush's first term. Senate leaders began negotiations over various compromise proposals on handling judicial nominations with the Republican leaders threatening to rule out the filibuster. By May 17 it appeared that Brown's nomination would not reach the Senate floor for another week or perhaps not until after Memorial Day.    In April 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved and sent for U.S. Senate confirmation, the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reid promised to filibuster against her. Republican Senate Majority leader Frist threatened a parliamentary maneuver to change Senate rules to permanently eliminate filibusters in judicial confirmations, including Supreme Court nominees. Six Republican Senators and six Democratic Senators considered a pact to vote to prevent judicial filibusters, except in &quot;extreme circumstances&quot;, and defeat filibuster rule changes. The vote on Brown's confirmation was expected in late May.    The long-dormant and controversial appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown will soon go before the Senate. Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called the nuclear option that would effectively outlaw filibusters. Moderate Democratic and Republican senators have been trying to work out a compromise that would enable confirmation votes to move forward without such a rule change, so far unsuccessfully. Democrats oppose her nomination, claiming she would advance extremist conservative views, particularly on issues regarding parental notification of abortions for minors. Republicans claim she is independent and hard-working, with an open mind and a lot of common sense. ",

As the Senate debated the issue of filibustering judicial nominations, a bipartisan group of centrist senators kept working on possible compromise solutions. On May 23, 14 moderate senators announced an agreement under which Democrats would vote to end debate on three nominations including Brown's, while Republicans agreed to oppose any attempt to change filibuster rules. On June 6 debate on  Brown's nomination opened with Republicans praising her great talent while Democrats deemed her an extreme conservative ideologue. On June 8, 10 Democrats joined Republicans to close debate and the Senate voted 56-43 to confirm Brown.    Just prior to the successful May 24, 2005 cloture vote for the first judicial nominee under Senate consideration (Pricilla Owen for U.S. Appeals Court 5th Circuit) 14 moderate Senators confirmed their mutual pact to: vote for cloture in judicial confirmations, except in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;; not change filibuster rules; and vote for cloture for three less contentious federal judicial nominees, including Brown and Owen. On June 6, the Senate opened debate on Brown's confirmation. On June 7, 10 Democrats joined in the successful vote for cloture for Brown. On June 8, the Senate approved Brown's judicial appointment by 56-43.    Averting a showdown, Senate Democrats and Republicans finally reached a compromise which cleared the way for confirmation votes on California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown's nomination to the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. After stalling Brown's nomination with a 2-year filibuster threat, Democrats agreed to vote for cloture, ending the debate on June 7. Republicans agreed not to force a change in the application of Senate filibuster rules by the so-called nuclear option. On June 8, Janice Rogers Brown won confirmation. ",

North Korea's position is that nuclear weapons are needed for their defense. The negotiations with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the UK and the US to persuade North Korea to cease its nuclear weapons programs are continuing without much progress. North Korea demands to be treated as a nuclear power and for disarmament talks to apply to all countries involved. South Korea has proposed that the international community aid North Korea economically and institute a rehabilitation program once the nuclear issue is resolved.    In February 2005 North Korea declared it manufactured nuclear weapons and won't rejoin six-nation talks (North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, U.S.). In May the IAEA reported N.K. had close to six nuclear weapons. N.K. and S.K. resumed direct talks. In July N.K. returned to six-nation talks after the U.S. recognized N.K.'s sovereignty. S.K. offered N.K. food, electricity, APEC membership, a multinational rehabilitation fund, and to establish a Northeast Asian Development Bank, if N.K. abandons nuclear weapons, which the U.S. called &quot;premature&quot;. N.K. said it would return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after its nuclear weapons program was resolved.     North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after the United States accused the country of having a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it has already built nuclear bombs. Since 2003, the six-nation (United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia) talks have aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and economic benefits and security guarantees.    Several rounds of six-party tallks on North Korea's nuclear program have broken down since August 2003 without an agreement. South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia want North Korea to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. Pyongyang insists on having nuclear power for peaceful purposes, something opposed by the U.S. South Korea has promised massive aid to North Korea, including electricity, rice, and other necessities, if an agreement can be reached within the six-party framework. It has also suggested a rehabilitation program for the North, a proposal that the U.S. and Japan strongly oppose. ",

A joint statement was signed with North Korea agreeing to rejoin the Treaty, to permit international inspectors, and to discontinue their nuclear weapons program. No timetable was determined. The international community promised to provide aid, security, energy assistance and work towards improving relations. The day after signing the statement North Korea reversed their decision to cease the weapons program until they receive a light-water reactor to create electricity.    The September 19, 2005 six-nations agreement included: N.K. giving up its nuclear weapons program; returning to the NPT and IAEA safeguards; The U.S. declared no nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula and no intention to attack N.K.; S.K. reaffirmed it doesn't have and won't deploy nuclear weapons; China, Russia, S.K., the U.S. and Japan agreed give N.K. a light-water reactor; N.K. and the U.S. pledge to respect each other's sovereignty, coexist peacefully, and normalize relations; N.K. and Japan agreed to normalize ties; China, Russia, S.K., Japan and the U.S. gave N.K. energy assistance. Australia offered N.K. energy, aid and expertise.    Talks with North Korea end with the signing of a joint statement. The document states that North Korea agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in return for recognition of its right to nuclear energy. It also agrees to submit to International Atomic Energy safeguards. China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the US give North Korea energy assistance and agree to discuss giving a light-water nuclear reactor for generating electricity. North Korea won't dismantle its nuclear program until it receives the reactor.    The six-party talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs resumed 13-19 September. Pyongyang pledged to abandon its nuclear programs, to rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and to follow IAEA safeguards in return for a pledge of aid and security. The U.S agreed not to attack North Korea. China, Russia, South Korea, the U.S., and Japan agreed to give North Korea energy assistance including a light-water reactor.

        "summary": "  On August 23, 2005 the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe charged that Lance Armstrong used the drug EPO in 1999. Armstrong strongly denied the charge. The French sports minister, the Tour de France director and the chief executive of the USCycling said that since the tests used as a basis for the charges were inadequate no action would be taken against the cyclist. A Texas scientist attributed Armstrong's performance to his modern training approach, not EPO. A specialist in the fight against doping in sports, however, suggested that Armstrong had used a range of banned substances.    On May 23, 2005 sports newspaper L'Equip reported Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for the 1999 Tour de France, based on urine samples examined outside World Anti-Doping Agency protocols, but linked to Armstrong by L'Equip, in violation of WADA anonymity rules. Tour Director Leblanc accepted the charge uncritically, but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible. The French Sports Minister agreed. USA Cycling, Miguel Indurain, and Ed Coyle defended Armstrong. Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999. An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending. Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Armstrong used other banned substances.    French newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. Armstrong strongly denied the charges and questioned the validity of the tests. USA Cycling, fellow cyclists, scientists and French fans have defended Armstrong. Defenders attacked the report as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound. Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated he had been doping. An Italian specialist believes Armstrong used other drugs, too. However, he has never been found guilty of doping.    A French newspaper accused Lance Armstrong of using the illegal performance-enhancing drug, EPO in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. The laboratory conducting the tests couldn't confirm the samples were Armstrong's, but the newspaper said it decoded the labels from samples identifying Armstrong. Armstrong strongly denies this charge. The director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, who studied Armstrong's physiology from 1992 to 1999, stated that Armstrong's record winning streak is explained by his years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France.

Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders. Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts. Hale denies any involvement in the murders.

Later that day, a local TV station receive a typed suicide letter, dated February 13, which included a hit list of judges, lawyers and doctors and a handwritten account of the Lefkow killings. Ross felt he was a medical malpractice victim and spent over a decade unsuccessfully pursuing lawsuits. Judge Lefkow, who recently ruled against Ross, was his primary target the day of the killings. DNA evidence confirm he was the killer.    Bart Ross, 57, was pulled over by police in a Milwaukee suburb for a defective taillight. Ross immediately committed suicide with a shot to his head. In his van was a letter describing how after treatment for mouth cancer left him disfigured, Judge Lefkow and others ruined his life by dismissing his medical malpractice suit. He vowed to kill them. On February 28th he hid in a Lefkow closet waiting for the judge, but her family found him first so he killed them instead. DNA from a cigarette butt in the home matched Ross's and he resembled a composite sketch.    The killer of Judge Lefkow's husband and mother, Bart Ross, killed himself on 9 March with a single shot to the head when he was stopped for a routine traffic violation. In his van was a suicide note linking him to the murders. He had pursued a decade-long malpractice suit over severe disfigurement resulting from treatment for a cancerous jaw, a suit Lefkow had dismissed a number of years ago. He wrote that she was &quot;No. 1 to kill&quot; because she had &quot;finished me off.&quot; He had a hit list of 25 other judges, lawyers, and doctors. ",

On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.    On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.    Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.    Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries. ",

More than 11,500 police and gendarmes in 300 cities and towns had been mobilized. Residents, police and firefighters suffered one death and more than 115 injuries. More than 7500 vehicles were torched. Although the riots were ignited by the accidental electrocution death of two teenagers, President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront inequalities and discrimination among its African and Muslim minorities that fueled the unrest. On Nov. 14 emergency powers were extended for three months.    After long police absence, Sarkozy's October 19 declaration of &quot;war without mercy&quot; on violent suburbs fueled the riots starting October 27. On November 8, France declared a state of emergency, and offered social assistance. By November 11, 118 residents, police, firefighters, and foreign journalists were injured, with $US 235 million total damage. By November 13, torched vehicles exceeded 8,000 and arrests exceeded 2,200. Vehicle torchings and arrests, respectively, November 1 - 12 were: 180/34, ?/?, 517/78, 897/250, 1300/349, 1408/395, 1173/330, 617/?, 482/?, 325/?, 384/162, 315/161. (Before the riots, 3,500 vehicles burned monthly nationwide.) France extended emergency powers on November 14.    With a state of emergency declaration, overnight curfews, and a public meetings ban, violent riots around Paris and throughout France steadily abated. The situation markedly improved by the 18th night. The French cabinet extended emergency police powers for three months to ensure an end to the riots. Some 300 towns and cities were affected and around 11,500 anti-riot forces were mobilized. Damages and casualties were considerable. Over 115 citizens, police officers and firefighters were injured, as were three foreign reporters. A rioter lost a hand throwing a Molotov cocktail. Over 7,500 vehicles were torched and dozens of buildings destroyed.    Rioting and unrest spread to some 300 areas across France. The government declared a state of emergency but left it to local authorities to enact curfews or other measures. Many areas did impose curfews but Paris only banned public meetings. Police were mobilized and made hundreds of arrests. Most rioters are young Arab and black residents who complain of economic misery and discrimination. They burned hundreds of vehicles and other acts of arson. President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront the inequalities and discrimination that fueled the unrest. For years, police had warned that immigrant-dominated slums were about to explode.  ",

Japan, Britain and the U.S. responded with rescue equipment. The British Navy used a robotic vehicle to free the submarine which then surfaced. The crew were in satisfactory condition and taken for medical examination. Russia's naval equipment has not been upgraded as promised by Putin following the Kursk submarine tragedy.    On Aug. 4, 2005 the Russian navy, working desperately to disengage a small military submarine with seven crew snagged by underwater cables at a depth of 625 feet off the Kamchatka peninsula, called for international help. Japan dispatched four vessels, Britain's Royal Navy sent a submersible Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and the U. S. Pacific fleet sent two vehicles similar to the British. Estimates varied as to how much oxygen remained for the entrapped crewmen. The British vehicle arrived first and on Aug. 7 the submarine was cut loose and the crewmen were found all alive.    For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay. The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system. Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply. When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help. Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts. A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub. All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.    A small Russian submarine with seven crew members was trapped on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula late on 4 August. The Russians tried desperately to pull the sub to shallower waters but those efforts failed. They sought international assistance. Japan sent four naval vessels, the U.S. sent three underwater vehicles, but the British were the first to arrive, with remote control submersibles.

Russian rescuers damaged their underwater robotic vehicle during the rescue attempt making it inoperable. When the British rescue vehicle arrived by air there was no equipment to unload it. Russia is considering purchasing a robotic Scorpio or Panther for underwater rescue operations. Adm. Kuroyedov, head of the Russian Navy, was fired and replaced by Adm. Masorin. Masorin has been charged with improving the Navy. Operation errors by the crew were cited as causing the accident.    Following recovery of the submarine, Russian authorities praised the international rescue effort and thanked Britain, the U.S. and Japan, but questions were soon raised as to why their navy did not have the proper equipment for such an operation. Updated equipment was soon purchased. President Putin ordered an investigation of the accident. On Sept. 4 Putin fired the head of the navy. On Sept 6 the defense minister announced that the submarine accident was a result of outrageous violations of the instructions by senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet and that the crew had made errors.    An investigation uncovered violations of instructions and errors in operating the mini-sub that contributed to the recent accident. Prosecutors accused a naval officer of negligence for damaging Russia's own Venom rescue vehicle, thereby necessitating international assistance. Newspapers criticized the navy for waiting over a day before revealing information about the accident. There are conflicting reports about whether the sub was caught in cables or fishing nets. The Russian navy is considering buying at least one Scorpio and possibly a newer model Panther rescue vehicle. The head of the Russian navy was fired, probably in part because of the accident.    Putin ordered the Defense Minister to launch an investigation. The head of the Navy was fired. A Navy captain was accused of damaging a Russian under-water remote-controlled vehicle in rescue attempts. Five British, one Japanese, and two Americans were given state awards. The seven crew members were given awards for bravery, but later accused of violating operating procedures and causing the sub's entanglement.

There is not yet evidence as to whether suicide bombers were involved. Police are close to identifying someone responsible for the bus attack.

All were British of Pakistani origin. Police raided five premises in Leeds and recovered a car they expect will yield evidence. Authorities were tipped off when one bomber's mother called a help line to report him missing. ABC News reported that the alleged bomb maker behind the London attacks was arrested in Egypt. Authorities fear that a number of recent arson attacks on mosques in England may have been retaliation for the bombings.    The death toll rose to 56 and 44 victims of the bombings remain in hospitals, nine in intensive care. Four of those dead were suicide bombers who carried out the bombings. Police identified three of the bombers by name and said that all four were British of Pakistani origin. Police were able to trace the movements on CCTV of the bombers from their arrival at a carpark until just before the explosions. Armed with warrants, police raided five premises in Leeds; home to a large Muslim population of south Asian origin.    The four bombers were British of Pakistani origin and were among the 56 killed. The bombers left their homes in West Yorkshire and drove a rented a car to Luton, NW of London, where they met a fourth accomplice. Closed circuit television at King's Cross caught them all chatting, then they split up. The mother of one reported him missing after the blasts, leading to identifications and raids on five premises in Leeds, which has a large Moslem population. The alleged bomb-builder was arrested in Egypt. After the bombings, several arson attacks took place on mosques in northwest England.    As of 20 July, the death toll stood at 56, with all victims identified. Police had finished their investigations on site and moved one subway car from the underground tunnel to a police compound for further investigation.  The suspected bombers, all four of whom were killed in the explosions, were Islamic extremists. British of Pakistani origin, the four were captured on closed ciruit TV at King's Cross soon before the bomings. An additional suspect was said to have been arrested in Cairo, Egypt, on 15 July. ",

The U.N. Chief, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France and Russia, called for full withdrawal. On March 5 the Syrian President promised pullback to the border. A top UN envoy on March 12 demanded a full withdrawal by April 30, a position supported by the European Union. By April 26 withdrawal was under way and the UN had sent a team to verify whether it was complete.    UN Security Council Resolution 1559 mandated withdrawal of &quot;foreign forces&quot; (Syria's troops and intelligence agents) from Lebanon. After the February 14, 2005 assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri, Anon told Syria to withdraw before April, threatening sanctions. Egypt and Saudi Arabia asked Syria to withdraw by April 30, under the 1989 Taif Accord. Lebanon's pro-Syria government resigned March 1. On March 12 Anon sent envoy Roed-Larsen to Syria with an ultimatum. Syria pledged to withdraw all troops. EU Foreign Ministers asked Syria to rapidly implement its pledge.     The February assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri put Syria under renewed pressure from the international community to abide by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The US, France and other European Union nations urged Syria to comply. Egypt and Saudi Arabia encouraged Syria to withdraw its troops by the U.N. deadline of April 30. Faced with a U.N. ultimatum, on April 3 Syria pledged to remove all troops and intelligence agents by April 30. The U.N. sent a team of inspectors to verify whether the withdrawal was complete at the end of April.    The killing of Lebanon's former PM Rafiq Hariri renewed calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of Lebanon. Nine council members voted for the resolution, six abstained. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable for withdrawal of its troops. The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that withdrawal must be handled with care. Under mounting pressure, Syria has withdrawn 4,000 of its 14,000 troops. ",

There were reports that some remained with a hit list of planned assassinations. Syria denied the accusations. The UN envoy had &quot;constructive and helpful&quot; talks with the Syrian president on June 12. One June 23, as another UN verification team investigated, US officials expressed certainty that Syrian military intelligence operatives remained in Lebanon.    By May 23, 2005, a UN team verified the pullout of all Syrian troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon. In June, President Bush warned Syria to withdraw its remaining intelligence agents in Lebanon. Syria denied having any intelligence agents in Lebanon. The UN verification mission went back to Lebanon to ascertain the facts. The UN said it was encouraged by talks with Syria's President regarding evidence from several countries that Syrian intelligence agents were still in Lebanon. Egypt and Saudi Arabia discussed the Syria-Lebanon situation. The U.S. reiterated its certainty that Syrian intelligence agents remained in Lebanon.    Although a U.N. team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon on April 26, the US and Lebanese opposition leaders insisted that Syrian intelligence agents remained in Lebanon. The killing of a prominent anti-Syrian journalist aroused suspicions that Syria had a hit list targeting opposition leaders. Syria rejected all accusations. US President Bush issued a new warning to Syria to withdraw intelligence forces. The   U.N. was encouraged by talks with Syria on the Security Council call for Syria to end its involvement in Lebanon. A U.N. verification team was sent to Lebanon by late June to investigate.    A UN team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops and intelligence officials from Lebanon after a 29-year presence. International pressure following the assassination of Raafik Hariri was more of a factor leading to the withdrawal than the UN resolution. A Lebanese Druse leader claimed that Syrian military intelligence was still operating in Lebanon and feared more assassinations after a bombing killed an anti-Syrian journalist. These reports caused US President Bush to warn Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Syria claimed that every troop and agent had left Lebanon.

        "summary": "  The Ukrainian presidential election race to replace President Kuchma is close and competitive. Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter. Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt. No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations. Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.    In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the Prime Ministry.    Ukraine's October 31 presidential elections reduced the candidates from 24 to two, pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovich and pro-west Viktor Yushchenko. The November 21 runoff election results are being disputed. Yushchenko is claiming Yanukovich's victory is the result of an illegal electoral commission decision and is demanding they be annulled. While campaigning, Yushchenko was struck by a mysterious illness in September and spent most of the month in an Austrian hospital. He and his supporters believe he was poisoned by political rivals. Doctors are still examining blood and other samples to determine the cause. They expect him to make a full recovery.    Ukrainian presidential elections were extremely close between the two leading candidates, pro-West Yushchenko and pro-Russia Yanukovich. Runoff elections on 21 November resulted in a standoff, with Yushchenko refusing to recognize Yanukovich as President and calling for new elections, and with Yanukovich saying that he would appoint Yushchenko Prime Minister. In September Yushchenko was treated in Vienna for a mysterious illness which paralyzed and scarred part of his face. Supporters claimed that the illness, which occurred after a meeting with the former head of the KGB, was an assassination attempt. Doctors said that they did not know the cause. ",

The poisoning investigation is ongoing. The earlier disputed presidential election was declared fraudulent and invalid by the Supreme Court. A repeat election was mandated. Foreign observers will help secure an honest election. Yushchenko was elected president of the Ukraine with 51.99 percent of the vote. As he took the oath of office Yushchenko vowed to improve economic conditions in the Ukraine. Viktor Yanukovych vowed to appeal the election results to the Supreme Court.    The Ukraine Supreme Court invalidated the November 21 election, due to election fraud. Yushchenko's ingested poison was identified as pure TCDD, a rare highly toxic form of Dioxin. Yushchenko deferred criminal investigations until after the repeat election December 26. Parliament failed to pass Yuschenko's election reforms, but the Constitutional Court ruled for expanded home voting, which helped Yushchenko. Yushchenko supporters pushed for Yanukovich's resignation; instead he took a leave of absence to run his campaign. The dual U.S.-Ukraine citizen Yushchenko won the Presidency 51.99% to 44.20% for Yanukovich. Yanukovich said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, without much hope.    In December, doctors determined conclusively that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned with the most lethal form of dioxin. Prosecutors reopened a criminal investigation into his attempted murder. Yushchenko was sure that Ukrainian authorities were responsible. He fell ill on September 6, after having food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine and others. The Ukraine Supreme Court overturned the November runoff election results due to fraud, and Parliament enacted new anti-fraud election reforms in December. Yushchenko won a repeat runoff on December 26 and took office in January, his face still disfigured by the poison.    Yushchenko was sworn in as President of Ukraine on Sunday 23 January. In a third round of voting on 26 December, Yushchenko won 51.99% of the vote to Yanukovich's 44.20%. The Supreme Court had annulled the results of the second round of voting because of election fraud. That decision followed 17 days of massive popular protests called the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; after Yushchenko's campaign color. Doctors confirmed that Yushchenko had been deliberately poisoned with TCDD, the most lethal form of dioxin. Blood tests revealed levels of dioxin &quot;more than 1000 times&quot; normal.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Sisters Study for breast cancer compares shared genes. Arimidex and Aromasin appear to sharply reduce breast cancer occurrence or metastasis. Oleic acid dramatically cuts expression of breast cancer precursor gene Her-2/neu and amplifies Herceptin. DNA repair deficiency strongly associates with susceptibility to breast cancer. Hypothyroidism apparently lessens chances of developing aggressive forms of breast cancer. Modern radiation therapy likely does not increase heart disease risk. Oral contraceptives likely do not increase the risk of BRAC1-associated breast cancer.    The National Health Research Institute and a pharmaceutical company are testing two medications that can treat breast cancer. One drug can curb a protein active in cancer patients and the other is less likely to trigger cardiovascular disease. A new U.S. Sister Study will investigate genetic and environmental causes of breast cancer. A new drug, aromatase inhibitor, appears to sharply reduce the chances of developing cancer in the other breast. Researchers say that olive oil may help fight breast cancer. Oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups.     Developmental drug SR-13668 curbs the oncogene protein AKT, prevalent in cancer patients; and SR-16158 reduces breast cancer patient heart disease risk. Aromatase inhibitors lessen breast cancer recurrence with fewer side effects than tamoxifen. Radiation therapy no longer carries heart disease risk. Olive oil suppresses oncogene Her-2/neu and boosts effectiveness of antibody Herceptin. Hypothyroidism and oral contraceptives reduce breast cancer risk. Sisters are being studied to investigate environmental and genetic affects on cancer risk. Deficiency in cell DNA repair-ability accelerates genetic changes leading to cancer. Protein markers in genes help predict cancer recurrence. Ductal lavage proved unreliable for detecting early cancer.    An international group is studying an aromatose inhibitor, which may replace tamoxifin. And a Taiwanese-U.S. cooperative effort is developing a new breast-cancer drug. NIH has undertaken a study of sisters to find genetic and environmental causes of the disease. Other studies are looking into the effects and effectiveness of oral contraceptives, an underactive thyroid, olive oil, a cell's ability to repair DNA, and the flushing of milk ducts. A new Dutch diagnostic tool could help some breast-cancer patients avoid unnecessary treatment. And advances in technology and techniques have now made radiation safe for breast-cancer patients. ",

        "summary": "  Herceptin reduced HER2-positive gene-associated breast cancer recurrences 52 percent. Avastin proved effective against breast cancer. Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ becomes invasive cancer in 40 percent of patients over 40 years. Combined chemotherapy and hormone therapy cut death in half within 15 years from recurring breast cancer. Consuming 33.3 fat grams daily reduces breast cancer recurrence 30% over five years. Exercise increases breast cancer survival 50%. Low melatonin levels in night-time workers increased breast cancer. Benign &quot;proliferative&quot; lesions correlate with later breast cancer. At 65 and older, early smaller localized tumors accounted for 96% of survival improvement; 38% under 50.    The drug Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients. Scientists reported that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat might reduce the chance that their tumors will return. A study showed that walking for three to five hours per week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent. Another study examining the role of childhood diet plays in breast cancer found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.    Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2. A low-fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence. Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades, can be mistaken as benign, and can take 40 years to develop. Night shift workers, women with benign breast lesions, and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer.     Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized. There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer. Studies have shown that both low-fat diets and exercise can increase survival rates for  breast cancer patients. But eating french fries in childhood can lead to cancer in adulthood. Night workers seem to have a higher incidence of breast cancer, indicating that there may be a relationship between tumor developent and exposure to light. ",

One children's TV network introduced a Saturday afternoon message encouraging children to go out and play. Some schools have expanded physical education programs, yanked junk foods from vending machines and reduced fat in cafeteria food. At least one YMCA has introduced a fitness room designed for pre-teens. Congress has considered legislation to control advertising to children and Kraft Foods promised to stop TV advertising of certain products considered unhealthy to children under 12.    To combat childhood obesity in the US, schools are removing unhealthy food from vending machines, reducing the fat in lunches, and requiring more physical education. New Hampshire is instituting twice-yearly weigh-ins for students. Children's hospitals have weight management programs and a YMCA has a kid-friendly fitness room. Efforts are being made to regulate advertising to young children. Manufacturers offer cereals low in sugar and salt with more vitamins and whole grains. US Cabinet secretaries and children's television networks are promoting healthier lifestyles for children. In New Zealand, schools added a mandatory extra hour of physical activity for students every week.    Scientists say reversing childhood obesity requires wide-ranging efforts. Less time should be spent in front of the computer and television. Schools should remove junk food from vending machines and reduce the fat in cafeteria lunches. Experts recommend reducing sugar consumption. Changes need to be made in food labeling and advertising as well as more school and community recreational facilities and physical education programs. Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or who are embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids.      Measures to fight childhood obesity include less time at the TV and computer, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school and community physical education programs and education to help children make better choices. The children's network Nickelodeon is encouraging children to go outside and play. They have also awarded grants to schools to expand physical play.

McDonald's has made a major marketing shift toward promoting healthier eating habits. Kraft Foods has developed whole-grain versions of two of its popular cookies. Abroad, schools in Bangkok, Thailand are banning sugary and fatty foods and drinks.    Dr. George Bray, founding president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, warns that high-fructose corn syrup is a strong culprit behind childhood obesity. Bray suggests that childhood obesity can be prevented by getting more sleep, decreasing sedentary activities, drinking more milk (calcium controls weight), thinking portion control and eating breakfast. An Institute of Medicine report found compelling evidence encouraging the food industry to change the nature of foods being marketed to children. Former US president Bill Clinton announced a 10-year initiative to combat childhood obesity.

The pair's lobbying for Indian tribes and Pacific islanders was shown to have benefitted the lobbyists and political associates while bilking the clients of millions of dollars. The House majority leader and a congressman were implicated. On Nov. 18, 2005 Michael Scanlon was charged with fraud and scheduled to go to court on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information, typically a prelude to pleading guilty and giving full cooperation with government investigators.    Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal. The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas. The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio. Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal. Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.    The Senate Indian Affairs Committee charged Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and fund-raiser, with running a crude extortion racket that has bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, additional congressmen and House aides are under an ethics investigation resulting from their connections with Abramoff. His activities in the Northern Marianas are also being investigated. Abramoff has been indicated in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and his partner, Michael Scanlon, was charged with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars.     Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff is being investigated in connection with manipulating elections and extorting lobbying fees of $66 million from six Indian tribes related to protecting gaming franchises, and $9 million from the Northern Mariana Islands related to the textile industry. Investigations also involve Abramoff's purchase of a gambling cruise ship company and arranging unreported golf junkets to Scotland. Abramoff invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Senate hearing. Also implicated are Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his former aide Michael Scanlon, Ralph Reed, Representative Robert W. Ney, and David Safavian. Safavian was indicted in connection with a golf trip.  ",

Michael Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe public officials and agreed to pay back over $19 million to Indian tribal clients. His possible 5-year prison sentence could be reduced should he cooperate with prosecutors. Abramoff pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion charges and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He did not identify officials by name. The next day he pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy in Florida. Panicked lawmakers, including President Bush, rushed to distance themselves from Abramoff by returning campaign money he gave them. The money is being returned or redirected to charities.    Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with federal officials investing political corruption. Abramoff is also facing trial on fraud charges in Florida connected with purchasing a casino cruise chip company. In his plea agreement, Abramoff committed to making 25 million in restitution to his victims and paying 1.2 million to the IRS for tax evasion. His prison sentence could be lowered depending on assistance he provides in the corruption investigation of as many as 20 members of Congress or top congressional aides.    Abramoff's extensive corruption schemes are the subject of a Senate probe and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and Florida prosecutors. Investigators are looking at congressmen, aides, government officials, and lobbyists, including Rep. John Doolittle, Stephen Griles, and Tony Rudy, and will follow the case wherever it leads.

She emerged from the Alderson prison on March 4 with head held high, 20 pounds lighter and a lot wealthier, since shares in her company nearly tripled in value.    In a Christmas message posted on her personal web site, Martha Stewart called for sentencing reform. She suggested pushing for reforms in federal sentencing guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders and particularly for drug offenders, who would be better served in rehabilitation than prison. She is scheduled to be released in early March 2004 and then must spend five months under house arrest. Her company announced that Stewart would host a daytime talk show after her sentence. Since her conviction, her company's share price has nearly tripled increasing her personal stake.

Martha's prison job was cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming and raking leaves. Via her website Martha received 15,000 fan e-mails, and said she was safe, fit and healthy but found the loss of freedom and privacy difficult. Fellow inmates shielded her from paparazzi.

There was much public speculation and some media reports of possible links between Rader and BTK including talk of a computer disc and DNA evidence, but investigators remained tight-lipped. On March 1 Rader was charged with 10 murders with bail set at $10 million. On April 19 Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing at which the prosecution would explain how the police had tied Rader to the killings. This, as the DA said, &quot;prolongs the agony of the public to know.&quot;    Rader's daughter did not turn her father in to police. Wichita investigators continue examining other killings, for possible linkage to BTK. Reportedly, DNA from Rader's daughter facilitated his identification. A computer disk in Rader's final mailing linked to his church. On March 31 Rader was charged with 10 first-degree murders. Bail was $10 million. His next court appearance was March 15. Rader waived his April 19 preliminary hearing. He would plead not guilty at arraignment May 3, and not plead insanity or plea bargain. Rader is no longer secluded from other prisoners. Kansas expected to pay $405,000 for Rader's defense.    Evidence identifying Dennis Rader as the BTK killer was found on a computer disk he mailed to a television station on February 16. Experts linked the disk to a computer at Christ Lutheran Church, where he served as the church council's president. Rader broke his 25-year silence after the Wichita Eagle published an article marking the 30th anniversary of the first BTK killings. Prosecutors cannot yet present their evidence against Rader because he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Nearby law enforcement agencies are reinvestigating cold cases that bear similarities to the BTK slayings.    Investigators continue to examine unsolved killings over the last 31 years to determine if any can be linked to BTK. Prosecutors cannot seek the death penalty for Rader since the killings occurred before its enactment. For three decades, BTK had toyed with Wichita in letters, poems and packages. It was his most recent mailing to a TV station that helped crack the case: a computer disk traced to the computer at Rader's church. The disk along with DNA evidence led to Rader. Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is expected to plead not guilty. ",

The UN urged Colombia to speed up negotiations for hostage release. December 2, the government announced it would pardon 23 FARC members to facilitate reaching a humanitarian accord with FARC. Colombian police may have kidnapped a FARC rebel in Venezuela.     FARC rejected a government proposal to hold talks aimed at exchanging rebels for hostages held by the guerillas. FARC asked the president to grant them the two southern demilitarized zones, before discussions could take place. The government denied their request because it has to guarantee the safety of the people across the country. The United Nations urged hostage release. The rebel groups released 12 hostages. The Columbian government plans to pardon more than 30 members of FARC as they negotiate a prisoner swap.    FARC rejected the government proposal for talks aimed at exchanging jailed rebels for hostages unless two southern counties were demilitarized. The government rejected that demand but released 50 jailed guerillas to build confidence. FARC followed with release of five kidnap victims. FARC killed another indigenous leader, Pervis Pacheco of the Kankuamo Indians and are believed to have killed the leader of Arhuaco Indians. Columbia's Supreme Court approved extradition of a FARC chief, among others, to the US to face charges of narco-trafficking and money laundering.

On July 1 federal agents raided Cunningham's San Diego residence and the MZM offices and yacht in Washington. Cunningham soon announced that he would not seek reelection and the executive stepped down. On August 13 Cunningham asked donors for permission to use their campaign contributions for legal expenses.    By July 2005 U.S. Representative Randall Cunningham was under investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the IRS and a federal grand jury probe. He received defense contractor MZM Inc's PAC money and personal donations from MZM President, Mitchell Wade. Wade paid a supposedly inflated price for Cunningham's and Cunningham paid Wade questionably little money to live on Wade's yacht in DC. Cunningham promoted MZM defense contracts, contributed to and served on a Wade-run charity board, and spoke at an MZM company party. Cunningham requested donors' permission to transfer campaign funds to his legal defense fund.    The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating Rep. Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor, Mitchell Wade, for an inflated price. Agencies are probing Wade's efforts to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts. Cunningham was living on Wade's yacht, which has also raised questions about improper financial links. He defended his boat arrangement as proper saying that he paid fees and services in lieu of rent. Cunningham is asking his contributors, including Wade, for permission to use their campaign donations for his legal defense.    Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, R-California, is a favorite of defense contractors who contribute heavily to his political campaign. The CEO of one company, MZM, Mitchell Wade, contributes to Cunningham's campaign and PAC, but  supports the congressman in other ways. When in Washington, Cunningham lives aboard Wade's yacht docked at a Potomac River yacht club and pays only docking fees. Wade purchased Cunningham's home in San Diego for over  $1.6M and a few months later sold it for a $700,000 loss suggesting that Cunningham was paid an inflated price.

To decrease costs and increase launches, India developed a universal launch pad for all future vehicles. India will host two international space conferences (planetary exploration and space law). India has signed an agreement with the European Space Agency and is talking with NASA regarding their participation in India's unmanned lunar launch. India's launch of the INSAT-4A has been delayed by the European Space Agency. Boeing cancelled their agreement with India to jointly produce communication satellites. India and Russia are collaborating on the development of a youth communication satellite.    For the first time, India is set to launch two satellites in a single mission. One is for mapping and the other for communications. India will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Some 225 delegates including many from the US, China, Japan, Canada, France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia will attend. The ISRO announced the payloads from the US, Bulgaria, Germany and Britain for the Chandrayaan-1 mission. Launch of the Indian INSAT-4A communications satellite from French Guyana has been delayed. India and Russia are working on a satellite for communication between youths of the two countries.    India's space program began in 1972. It aspires to be a major space power. India developed a unique universal launching pad and plans a sophisticated propellant plant for its launch vehicle, delayed by sanctions following India's 1998 nuclear testing. India has launched eleven remote-sensing satellites and two satellites in one mission. Communication satellites include Hamsat for Ham radio and distance-learning Edusat. India and Russia plan a youth communication satellite. In 2005 ISRO hosted international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Europe's Ariane program problems delayed launch of India's telecast and communication satellite INSAT-4A. Boeing withdrew from Indian satellite cooperation.     The Indian Prime Minister has criticized economic sanctions imposed after the 1998 nuclear weapons tests, but noted that these have not hindered India's scientific progress. India launched one rocket carrying two satellites, one for more detailed mapping, the other for home radio operators. Its first unmanned moon mission, scheduled for 2007-2008, will carry three European payloads and perhaps one U.S. payload. Meanwhile India is working with Russia to develop a satellite to enable youths in the two countries to communicate. It will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law for about 225 delegates in June.  ",

The school board argues it is informing students about differences of opinion, not endorsing any religious view. The trial is underway.    Pennsylvania's Dover School Board voted requiring teachers to read a brief statement about intelligent design to students before teaching classes on evolution. Intelligent design implies that nature is so complex it must be the work of a single creator rather than evolution. The school board stated that intelligent design provides an alternative to teaching evolution and denies that it is &quot;religion in disguise.&quot; Dover parents brought suit against the school board charging that teaching &quot;intelligent design&quot; is a clear violation of the principle of separation of church and state.    The Dover, Pennsylvania, school board passed a resolution requiring students in a 9th grade biology course be told evolution &quot;is a theory, not a fact&quot; and &quot;intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs&quot; from evolution. Board members who voted 6-3 for the measure made it clear they believed the origin of life was guided by a heavenly hand.

For the next three weeks, the defense called witnesses who testified that intelligent design is not based on religious beliefs, but on observable, physical evidence from nature. The judge ruled that compelling teachers to present intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the Constitution. Dover residents ousted all eight school board members running for re-election who put their town in the global spotlight.    At the trial, a biochemistry professor at Lehigh and lawyers at the Thomas More Law Center testified for teaching intelligent design as a credible scientific theory. Scientists testifying for the parents dismissed intelligent design because it can't be tested by experiment. A federal judge ruled that teaching intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution. He wrote that the overwhelming evidence established that intelligent design is a religious view and not a scientific theory and its inclusion in public schools violates the separation of church and state.    Both sides agreed to a bench trial without a jury, common in First Amendment cases where arguments are about legal rather than factual issues. At the trial, board members said they wanted to &quot;encourage critical thinking.&quot; However, the parents presented evidence the board's purpose was religious and the intelligent design statement was a compromise after they could not teach creationism.

Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena.

MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.    After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero.

Its main use remains as a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring. It has greater tensile strength than steel and costs less and lasts longer than oak flooring. It is environmentally friendly and sustainable since it grows fast and can be harvested within five years. Bamboo shoots are a traditional part of Asian cuisine but must be properly prepared to avoid causing harm. The bamboo plant is the staple panda food. But when the plant flowers and produces seeds, pandas will not eat it and are in danger of starving.    Bamboo is used for flooring, paneling, and furnishings. Its tensile strength is greater than steel, it's harvestable in 3-5 years, and it's inexpensive. India makes bamboo housing for earthquake survivors. Ethiopia is developing its extensive bamboo commercially with China's help. A pulp mill for bamboo-like Arundo donax would benefit Alabama economically but residents fear the plant's invasiveness. California imported it for windbreaks. Giant pandas are increasing in China due to expanded bamboo forests and moving pandas when local bamboo flowers and becomes inedible. KFC in China substitutes bamboo shoots for coleslaw. Incorrect preparation of fresh shoots risks hydrogen cyanide exposure. ",

The U.S. National Zoo's research advances in giant panda reproductive cycles and artificial insemination will increase endangered giant panda populations in captivity and in the wild. India is building two commercially viable, environmentally friendly, one-megawatt, &quot;green power&quot; bamboo gasification-based electricity plants. A wide variety of bamboo fiber rugs are available, including kiln-dried and carbonized bamboo with polyurethane coatings.    Nigeria is using bamboo to revitalize its agriculture. It has set up a database exploring its abundant bamboo resource to produce byproducts. A state in northeast India plans to set up power stations that run on bamboo to help meet the regions energy needs. A Chinese company has successfully produced fiber from maize and blended it with bamboo fiber to make environment-friendly clothes. Forestry experts in northwest China have identified more than 20 insects, which are causing arrow bamboo to wither and die causing shortages of food for pandas. Help for pandas is being arranged.    China earned as much as $3.5B in foreign exchange from the bamboo-based sector in 2003. Nigeria hopes to follow that example and effectively explore its abundant bamboo resources that can turn out about 300 byproducts. India, second to China in bamboo production, is set to pioneer environmentally friendly power stations that run on bamboo. New products from bamboo include non-slip rugs, fiber for clothing and pre-fabricated quake-shelters. Bamboo's 60-year blooming and seeding cycle and the identification of more than 20 insects that plague arrow bamboo threaten the staple of the pandas' diet.     Retailers offer bamboo-extract towels and bamboo rugs. A Chinese company introduced bamboo fiber in 2004. A bamboo-maize blend makes soft, comfortable, wrinkle-resistant clothing. Bamboo earned China $3.5 billion in 2003. Nigeria is partnering with China to develop its vast bamboo reserve. India is pioneering a power station to turn bamboo into gas then electricity and run local paper mills. Arrow bamboo, plagued by over 20 insects, is low in nutrition but giant pandas' main food.

Without a national consensus, existing state and local government laws vary widely. Drivers either ignore or are unaware of existing laws. Enforcement is not uniform. Lobbyists oppose legislation and argue driver distraction by various factors is at fault not cell-phone technology. A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that there is little difference between hand-held and hands-free device driver distraction. The survey confirms that cell-phone use while driving increases injuries and deaths.    The District of Columbia, New York and New Jersey passed legislation that bans using hand-held cell phones while driving. More than 400,000 tickets and warnings have been issued since New York first enacted this law. New Mexico and Chicago City only allow hands-free cell phone. Texas is considering cell phone laws. An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety survey said using any cell phones while driving is dangerous. Drivers using cell phones are four times as likely to end up in a crash as drivers who didn't use a cell phone.    Forty-five countries banned hand-held phone use while driving. In the US only New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia completely ban hand-held phone use. Some states direct hand-held bans to specific groups such as school bus drivers or those on learner's permits. Some municipalities have enacted bans but some have been overturned by states declining to take action against cell phone use. Some jurisdictions permit hands-free cell phone use. Cell phone bills in Texas and California failed to carry. Laws are often ignored and enforcement spotty. However, Washington police average 600 tickets and 250 warnings each month.    The District of Columbia, NY state, New Jersey, Connecticut and Chicago ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states or cities ban use with learner's permits, by school bus drivers, by minors for six months after getting their licenses, or require hands-free phones.

These laws are more likely to pass and maintain their constituents support. The cell-phone industry states that the percentage of accidents caused are very low. Judging cell-phone law results are difficult due to the lack of clear evidence in accidents except from witnesses or driver admissions. Driver education is a large part of cell-phone law enforcement. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey prompted the Department of Defense to restrict driver cell-phone use on military facilities. Enforcement policies vary by military base.      In 2005, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones while driving. Bills were passed or are still being considered in 22 states. The National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to restrict young drivers because teens account for a large share of traffic fatalities and cell phone use increases the problem. However, enforcing laws for young drivers is difficult. Both the U.S. Virgin Islands and Lackland Air Force Base have cell phone laws in place.    Every state has considered legislation on cell phones behind the wheel but only a few have banned them unless they are hands-free. Connecticut and Chicago have joined New York, New Jersey and DC in prohibiting use of hand-held phones. Many states have put limits on teens using cell phones while they drive. Enforcement of laws banning cell phone use while driving is a problem. Nearly everyone supports the laws, nearly everyone ignores them. The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use by motorists but left it for the military services and individual bases to decide how to enforce it.    The US Virgin Islands now bans hand-held cell phone use while driving. Eleven states including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland and Tennessee ban cell phone use by young drivers. California prohibits phone use while driving by bus drivers but not others. Under a Pentagon directive, bans on cell phone use while driving are becoming common on military bases. In 2005, 38 states tried to pass restrictive legislation. Effectiveness is difficult to assess because drivers or witnesses must confirm cell phone use coincided with accidents.

The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.    Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.    After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea.

Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.     Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.    Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent. Terrorist attacks are being simulated using computer models. The 2005 Energy Bill calls for increased energy production and grid modernization. ",

        "summary": "  Other power grid vulnerabilities include accidental line cuts during maintenance, equipment malfunction or failure, old grid infrastructure and poor grid design causing power loss over wider areas. Improvements in grid architectures will increase network resilience. Deregulation resulted in lower margins for reserve power capacity and transmission capacity, as well as loss of experienced personnel. As companies specialized more in generation or transmission, supervisory data became proprietary and unavailable to regional grid managers. An August 2005 federal law will create a process for mandating reliability rules. Energy conservation and smart appliances that cut back during power grid stresses can avert blackouts.    The blackout in August 2003 that struck the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada was primarily caused by the deregulation of the utility companies. Experts said that changes in the industry had several adverse effects, including loss of experienced personnel and lawyers and MBAs now heading these competitive companies rather than engineers. Power plant capacity and its state of repair are proprietary now and not available to system operators who manage regional power grids. The energy law provides for mandatory reliability rules, but no power to enforce rules.    The factor widely considered behind the blackout of 2003 is the deregulation of the electric system. Under a regulated system, utilities could add transmission lines to increase reliability and their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process. Market participants prefer lower margins to drive up prices. A new energy bill now provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules. Some firms have identified advances in technology: cheap, powerful chips, more capable software and broadband communications that will impact on the energy business. Power saving devices and developing alternate power sources can contribute to the reliability of the power system.    California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 to deal with strains on the grid. In 2005 Los Angeles suffered three significant electrical failures, due to mistakes by workers or automatic systems. In 2005 the US and Canada discussed deregulation of the electric system, widely considered to be a cause of the 2003 blackout. Utilities now have little incentive to invest in transmission lines, keep reserve power to minimize shortages, or share information on power plant operating status. Plants operate closer to reliability limits more often. MBAs and lawyers head power companies rather than engineers. Energy company ownership continues to consolidate. ",

However, gay marriage is not legal in Sweden and Taiwan. Many countries have legalized civil unions, but not gay marriage.    Canada passed legislation authorizing gay marriages and granting same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions. In Sweden, civil unions between homosexuals are legal and the government will decide if the law should be changed to include marriage. Under the Civil Partnership Act passed in Britain, homosexual couples will have the same rights as heterosexual couples.

        "summary": "  President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court caused much consternation. The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire &quot;inadequate,&quot; &quot;insufficient,&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;    President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.     President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.    President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; and asked her to redo it. ",

Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated. Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House, but the committee chair denied intruding on executive privilege. Democrats blamed the failure on right-wing ideologues. Sen. Lott (R-MS) blamed it on a nomination based on cronyism. On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned her conservative credentials, lack of judicial experience and criticized her for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House. Others said the White House bungled the nomination from the start. Many agreed that although she is a very capable person, President Bush shouldn't have chosen someone not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     President Bush announced that Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court. The announcement was met with a blend of regret, relief and a feeling that she had been treated poorly. Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents. Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling and the White House had capitulated to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Right Wing partisans expressed relief and some jubilation at her withdrawal.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court three and a half weeks after its initial announcement. Bush declared on 27 October that his choice had withdrawn her name and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her decision. She claimed that the fight over her nomination would be a burden for the White House. She also said that she wanted to protect the independence of the executive branch, citing the battle over access to her White House legal writings. She will continue to serve as White House counsel. Bush promised to name a replacement &quot;in a timely manner.&quot; ",

Several independent sightings and video by teams from the Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, ruled out the similar pileated woodpecker and confirmed the rediscovery, which was kept secret for over a year to prepare to protect the bird's habitat not least from a flood of bird watchers, for which private groups, including The Nature Conservancy spent about $10 million, and the Interior Department committed over $10 million.    The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years. The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker. There have been 15 sightings captured on video although researchers can't determine how many were seen. The government proposed $10 million for efforts to protect the bird. Private groups will contribute another $10 million.     The ivory-billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed. There have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during more than 7,000 hours searching.    The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp. Its existence has been confirmed by at least 8 sightings, a 4-second video, and its distinctive &quot;double-knock&quot; drumming. The first sighting was in February 2004 but was kept secret for over a year while experts confirmed the discovery and protected the bird's territory. Private groups and individuals have raised $10 million for protection of the woodpecker and its environment, while the federal government has proposed $10 million in federal funds.

They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird. But they and others remained skeptical. In December over 100 researchers and volunteers began an intensive six-month search across 500,000 acres of Arkansas wetlands seeking definitive evidence of the bird. A local town benefited from bird watching tourists. In January 2006 Jackson published an article saying claims for proof of the bird's existence constitute &quot;faith-based ornithology&quot;.    Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker. The issue is whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker. Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence. A crew from Cornell Lab and its partner agencies will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search of 500,000 acres in the eastern Arkansas wetlands. An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker.    Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct. However, more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts. Cornell ornithologists made 17,000 hours of recordings near the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas. The discovery raised concerns that this habitat could be inundated with bird watchers. Cornell will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search for the bird. Federal authorities have provided $10.2M toward the effort and the Nature Conservancy has bought 18,000 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside for the bird.    The rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker was challenged in late April, almost three months after its announcement. Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient, a conclusion also reached by Sibley, author of well-known field guides. But two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge and the paper was not published. In January 2006, however, the third biologist voiced the strongest criticism to date, saying that he was still not convinced. The search continues. ",

In February 2005 rallies in Bishkek urged President Akayev to step down as promised and constitutionally required after October presidential elections, fearing a referendum to continue his reign. Akayev supporters won a landslide parliamentary victory. Opposition leaders and the European Organization for Security and Cooperation charged the elections were flawed. By March 16 opposition forces rallied, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, demanded Akayev's resignation, and took hostage a regional governor and district chief. On March 20 four policemen were beaten after police fired shots at demonstrators. Akayev ordered investigations into election fraud charges and fired the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Kyrgyz oppositionists, fearing President Akayev might hold onto power longer than his constitutional two terms, rallied and urged him to step down. He refused, saying elections were fair, opposition leaders were unnecessarily inciting civil war, and talks were the solution to the crisis. The opposition refused to accept a landslide victory by Akayev supporters in parliamentary elections and claimed fraud. They blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and took a governor and district chief hostage. When police fired shots to dispel rioters, crowds beat four policemen to death. Akayev ordered fraud claims investigated and replaced the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 27 February, with presidential elections planned for October. Akayev supporters won a landslide victory in most areas, but both opposition leaders and western observers cited mass violations. Run-off parliamentary elections were held in many regions on 13 March. The opposition was defeated but refused to accept the results and demanded Akayev's resignation. Even before the election, opposition leaders had been calling for Akayev to step down as President at the end of October in accordance with the constitution. But Akayev refused to resign or to annul the election results. ",

        "summary": "  On March 24, 2005 mass protests outside the presidential compound in Bishkek turned violent. Demonstrators broke into the building and beat several officials severely. Akayev fled the country for Russia and soon announced in Moscow that he would resign if the Kyrgyzstan government would guarantee his safety. On April 3 a Kyrgyzstan parliamentary delegation arrived in Moscow and after 3 hours of talks Akayev signed a resignation document. He also taped an 18-minute farewell address to be played in Bishkek while he remained in Moscow. New presidential elections are scheduled for June 26.    On March 24, 2005 protestors stormed the main Kyrgystan government building and Akayev fled to Russia. The elected pro-Akayev parliament nonetheless elected an Akayev opponent as Speaker and called for new presidential elections on June 26. On April 3, Akayev signed his resignation in Moscow, which was notarized in lieu of a constitutional requirement that he present his resignation in person to parliament. Because his safety still could not be guaranteed, due to continued calls for his impeachment, his recorded resignation was to be heard and accepted by a special session of parliament on April 6 and broadcast live.    Opposition against Akayev strengthened with international criticism for election abuses, his government's crackdown on opposition groups and independent media, and his failure to bring those responsible for killing six peaceful demonstrators in 2002 to justice. Poverty and widespread corruption contributed to public anger. Akayev fled to Russia after opposition supporters stormed the main government building and mobs looted parts of Bishkek. He resigned as president in Moscow, with impeachment the alternative. In his address to the nation, Akayev apologized to people who bore him grudges, hoped the presidential election would be democratic, and said he wouldn't fight the new government.    Massive uprisings continued in Kyrgyzstan, fueled by anger over the rigged parliamentary elections. When protesters finally stormed the presidential compound on 30 March, President Akayev fled to Moscow. Two nights of looting and gunfire followed in Bishkek. A delegation headed by the new speaker of Parliament went to Moscow to negotiate with Akayev. Akayev signed his formal resignation at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow on 4 April. His recorded statement was to be shown to Parliament and then broadcast on national television. Presidential elections are now scheduled for 26 June. ",

He could face up to three years in prison. The US and EU called on Turkey to drop the charges. His December 16 trial was suspended until February 7 because the court lacked a justice ministry order to proceed. The case has stirred outrage across Europe. EU officials were there to observe the trial, the outcome of which could damage the Turkey's chances of joining the EU.    Prominent Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk, was indicted over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres. Pamuk is charged under Turkey's penal code which carries a jail term of more than three years for a person who &quot;explicitly insults&quot; the Turkish republic. The European Union (EU) warned Turkey that its prosecution of Pamuk could damage its chance of joining the EU and is a test of Turkey's commitment to freedom of expression and reforms in its law. European countries, U.S. and activist organizations have criticized Turkey's lack of democratic principles and citizen's rights.     In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage. He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for &quot;public denigration of the Turkish identity,&quot; carrying up to 3 years in jail. Turkey says the deaths were fewer and from civil unrest, not genocide. The US, European Union, and activist organizations criticized Turkey's criminal charges for freedom of expression. The EU said Pamuk's trial would affect Turkey's EU bid. A Turkish court ruled Pamuk should be tried under old laws requiring justice ministry direct order and postponed the trial.    Orhan Pamuk went to court on 16 December for outspoken comments made during a Swiss newspaper interview about the Armenian massacres. The EU warned that the trial could affect Turkey's EU accession process because it would indicate the strength of Turkey's commitment to recent reforms guaranteeing freedom of expression. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said, &quot;It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial, but Turkey.&quot; The trial was suspended until 7 February pending a decision from the Justice Ministry. The offense had been made before the new penal code had gone into effect and therefore came under the old law. ",

        "summary": "  Turkey was heavily criticized by international human rights groups over Orhan Pamuk's trial. Turkish intellectuals and EU officials demanded that Turkey change the laws that limit freedom of expression. To avoid an EU confrontation, Turkey's justice minister sent Pamuk's case back to the local Istanbul court, which then dropped the charges on a technicality. The EU welcomed the ruling, which came just days before it was to begin a review of Turkey's justice system. Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.      A group of 169 Turkish intellectuals asked the government to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression and interfere with Turkey's democratic process. Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk stating that it wasn't legally competent to judge this case. The court was chided for framing the dismissal in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing freedom of expression. About 70 intellectuals have been charged as well, but they don't have the same high profile as Pamuk. The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases.    Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to rule on whether Pamuk should be tried, citing recent penal code amendments. It sent the case back to the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk. The case divided Turkey and embarrassed its liberals. Pamuk's remarks also highlighted another painful episode in Turkish history, the 30,000 Kurdish deaths in recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's Kurdish southeast. Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression. Potential EU partners wanted to know that Turkish laws were the same as laws elsewhere in the EU.    The case against Orhan Pamuk ended on 23 January. The Justice Ministry had refused to issue an approval of the prosecution and told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed. The Istanbul court dropped the charges. Pamuk's lawyer criticized the decision, saying that it was framed in bureaucratic terms and avoided the issue of freedom of expression. Turkish nationalists were outraged. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said that Pamuk was not the only one facing such charges, he was &quot;just the most high-profile case.&quot; PEN says that some 70 Turkish intellectuals have been charged with similar offenses.
