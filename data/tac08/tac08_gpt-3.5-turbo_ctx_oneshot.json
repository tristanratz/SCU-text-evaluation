Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.    Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.    The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.    In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.

Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.    Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.    In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.    The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism.

Wildlife including polar bears, reindeer, seals, and fish are threatened as well as many plant species. Fishing zones are disappearing. Shipping lanes are at risk. The Arctic and Antarctic of today will be radically changed within the next century if action is not taken worldwide.    Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears. Less ice reflects less sunlight, warming the planet, leading to more ice melt and sea-level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100. Greenland's ice fishing season has shortened. Lake areas doubled. Glaciers Sermeg, Sermilik, and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster. Alaska's Columbia glacier also melted faster.    Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. If this occurs, considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere, which could amplify global warming. However, another researcher disagrees that the thaw would be so large. He states that Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.     Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change.

Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.    Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.    Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit. Seniors choosing a Medicare Part D-approved private drug insurance plan risk loosing their other medical insurance. Employers used Part D federal subsidies to reduce retirees' overall health premiums; others dropped retiree health plans entirely.

The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.      Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents.

Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.    Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed &quot;Terri's law&quot; through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional.

Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially.

Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt. There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.      Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.    The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of &quot;planet.&quot; Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight &quot;inner&quot; planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.     Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena.

Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects. However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument. Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue. The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces. Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313. The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.    A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena). Both might be called &quot;minor planets&quot; or could be considered KBOs. NASA's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto's claim to planethood by finding its second and perhaps third moon. On Jan 20, 2006 NASA launched its New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt which it is scheduled to reach in July 2015. Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto's 1380. The IAU committee continues to deliberate.    Debate continues over what constitutes a planet. Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers (both Pluto and UB313 do). Another suggestion is roundness: this would include these two and likely several others yet unknown. Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate its surroundings, which would exclude Pluto and UB313. Pluto became more interesting when the Hubble telescope discoverd that Pluto had not just one but three moons. Scientific interest in Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission: a nine year trip to Pluto and beyond.     Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term. KBO 2003 UB313, discovered by Michael E. Brown, was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto. Both have surface methane ice. If Pluto is a planet, 2003 UB313 should be too. The Hubble Space Telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto, 30-100 miles in diameter. Pluto and its large moon Charon, close physically and in size, may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between them. At least four KBOs have known moons.

Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2. A low-fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence. Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades, can be mistaken as benign, and can take 40 years to develop. Night shift workers, women with benign breast lesions, and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer.     Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized. There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer. Studies have shown that both low-fat diets and exercise can increase survival rates for  breast cancer patients. But eating french fries in childhood can lead to cancer in adulthood. Night workers seem to have a higher incidence of breast cancer, indicating that there may be a relationship between tumor developent and exposure to light.

Little else has been revealed as to how the perpetrator of these crimes was identified and tracked down.    After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas &quot;BTK serial killer&quot;, Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005.

Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.    Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.     Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.    Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent.

Improvements in grid architectures will increase network resilience. Deregulation resulted in lower margins for reserve power capacity and transmission capacity, as well as loss of experienced personnel. As companies specialized more in generation or transmission, supervisory data became proprietary and unavailable to regional grid managers. An August 2005 federal law will create a process for mandating reliability rules. Energy conservation and smart appliances that cut back during power grid stresses can avert blackouts.    The blackout in August 2003 that struck the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada was primarily caused by the deregulation of the utility companies. Experts said that changes in the industry had several adverse effects, including loss of experienced personnel and lawyers and MBAs now heading these competitive companies rather than engineers. Power plant capacity and its state of repair are proprietary now and not available to system operators who manage regional power grids. The energy law provides for mandatory reliability rules, but no power to enforce rules.    The factor widely considered behind the blackout of 2003 is the deregulation of the electric system. Under a regulated system, utilities could add transmission lines to increase reliability and their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process. Market participants prefer lower margins to drive up prices. A new energy bill now provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules. Some firms have identified advances in technology: cheap, powerful chips, more capable software and broadband communications that will impact on the energy business. Power saving devices and developing alternate power sources can contribute to the reliability of the power system.    California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 to deal with strains on the grid. In 2005 Los Angeles suffered three significant electrical failures, due to mistakes by workers or automatic systems. In 2005 the US and Canada discussed deregulation of the electric system, widely considered to be a cause of the 2003 blackout.

On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire &quot;inadequate,&quot; &quot;insufficient,&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;    President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.     President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.    President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; and asked her to redo it.

Democrats blamed the failure on right-wing ideologues. Sen. Lott (R-MS) blamed it on a nomination based on cronyism. On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned her conservative credentials, lack of judicial experience and criticized her for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House. Others said the White House bungled the nomination from the start. Many agreed that although she is a very capable person, President Bush shouldn't have chosen someone not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     President Bush announced that Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court. The announcement was met with a blend of regret, relief and a feeling that she had been treated poorly. Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents. Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling and the White House had capitulated to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Right Wing partisans expressed relief and some jubilation at her withdrawal.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court three and a half weeks after its initial announcement. Bush declared on 27 October that his choice had withdrawn her name and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her decision. She claimed that the fight over her nomination would be a burden for the White House.

The EU welcomed the ruling, which came just days before it was to begin a review of Turkey's justice system. Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.
