Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province, and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began, the first tangible result of the peace talks.During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years.A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005.There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders.", "stus": ["India and Pakistan became separate nations", "India and Pakistan became in 1947", "Since India and Pakistan became separate nations in 1947 India and Pakistan fought two wars over Kashmir , the Himalayan province which was split between India and Pakistan", "the Himalayan province which was split between India and Pakistan", "the Himalayan province which was split between them", "Kashmir , the Himalayan province which was split between them is India only majority Islam province", "an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side", "an Islam insurgency began in 1989", "More than 45,000 people were killed .", "A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003", "Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels", "Prime Minister Singh of India reduced by 40,000", "Prime Minister Singh of India reduced in a force of 500,000", "Peace talks began in 2004", "in March 2005 bus service between India and Pakistan began the first tangible result of Peace talks", "India and Pakistan is the two countries", "During November 2004 India 's prime minister reduced troops", "During November 2004 India 's prime minister reduced on the Kashmir border", "During November 2004 India 's prime minister reduced as a goodwill gesture", "During November 2004 India 's prime minister reduced prior to India 's prime minister visit", "While there India 's prime minister met with Kashmiri separatist leaders", "India 's rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent , placed under joint control , or put under UN administration", "some Kashmir areas placed under joint control", "some Kashmir areas put under UN administration", "the peace process begun in January", "the peace process facilitated by a year - long ceasefire", "Pakistani controlled sections", "Consequently on April 7 , 2005 limited bi - weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani - controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years", "A border ceasefire begun November 25 , 2003", "The US pressured Pakistan", "The US pressured to control militant groups", "India 's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress", "India 's and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December .", "Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India 's / Pakistan or UN control", "Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan", "Indian PM Singh rejected redrawing the border", "Indian PM Singh redrawing the border", "India 's withdrew some border troops", "Indian PM Singh visited Kashmir", "Indian PM Singh visited three times", "Indian PM Singh announced a Kashmiri economic development plan", "Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005", "There appears to be progress in the Indian - Pakistani dispute over Kashmir .", "The bilateral ceasefire held for a year", "The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders", "The Indian Prime Minister met for the first time", "India reduced the number of border troops", "India announced a multibillion - dollar development plan", "Bus service been opened for the first time in 57 years", "The Pakistani President suggested three solutions : Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian - Pakistani control or put under UN administration", "could made independent", "Some areas of Kashmir could placed under joint Indian - Pakistani control", "Some areas of Kashmir could put under UN administration", "However India ruled division along religious lines or redrawing international borders"]}, {"instance_id": "d0902-A", "summary": "The FDA has approved the use of an emergency contraceptive, called the morning-after pill.

If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely.On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the display of the Ten Commandments on government property. In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June.A homeless man, Thomas Van Orden, in Texas is challenging the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and two stars of David on the Capitol grounds. A Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses. Opponents of the displays argue the displays violate the First Amendments prohibition on establishing an official state religion. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one. The Bush administration has argued on behalf of the displays. Questioning by justices during hearings suggests they are headed for a split decision.The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses.

She helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and a group that later became NARAL. For two decades she led demonstrations, protest marches, and news conferences.

IBM, its supplier for 14 years, was unable to deliver its new PC chip that promised more power and less heat, both needed for laptops Apple planned. The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games.Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple has been frustrated by IBMs failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat. After weeks of rumors, Jobs announced that the switch would be made by 2007. Apple must now persuade software developers to make their programs run on Intel chips. Apple's operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows. Intel's CEO said his company is thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer.Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple's annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors. Apple engineers have secretly worked on a transition for five years. Every edition of Macintosh OS X since then has been designed to run on both IBM and Intel chips. Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both chips. Apple's lower-end computers, like the Mac Mini, will get Intel chips in June 2006. Apple's entire computer line will have them by December 2007.On 6 June Apple Computer announced plans to abandon its 14-year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating.

Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005.Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States, Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas. Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming.Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor, is not a new idea and is gaining support. In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground. Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe, reliable, and dependent on cost. The question arises if the process could cause an earthquake.Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996.

Khan, Pakistan's revered father of its nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to black market dealings in nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned, but remains under house arrest. Recent investigations found evidence that Khan delivered bomb blueprints and weapons-grade enriched uranium to Iran. He sold warhead blueprints to Libya and possibly to North Korea. Evidence surfaced of his vast global enterprise, his facilities in Dubai and South Africa, and international connections from Asia to Africa. Pakistan's government expressed skepticism over recent claims and refuses to allow foreign authorities question Khan.Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales.A.Q. Khan sold nuclear bomb technology and material to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Possible motives were profit, ego, and a guarantee of Muslim influence. He traded centrifuge technology to China for bomb design. Pakistan claims to cooperate with the international community and put Khan under house arrest but won't let him be questioned. President Musharraf pardoned Khan, let him keep his profits, and denied government involvement. The US, not wanting to alienate ally Pakistan, quarreled with the IAEA and is investigating separately. Khan chief lieutenant Tahir is in jail. Khan's network operated in over 30 countries, including South Africa.A.Q. Khan headed an illicit, global, network, providing nuclear information and material to at least Libya, Iran, and North Korea. He visited other potential customers and uranium suppliers. He appears motivated by hatred of India, monetary gain, egotism, and pan-Muslim and anti-Western goals. The US had tracked him for years and pressured his confession to nuclear proliferation in 2004, but could not be too forceful because of Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror.

Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be \"swing votes.\" In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that \"world opinion is against us\" in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18.On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal.The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states.In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles.
