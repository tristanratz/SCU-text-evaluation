    "summary": "Since they became separate nations in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the Himalayan province which was split between them.  Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province, and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began, the first tangible result of the peace talks.During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years.A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005.There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders.",

Barr Pharmaceuticals proposed that the FDA allow girls age 16 or older to obtain the drug over the counter. Proponents claimed it would be invaluable in preventing unplanned pregnancies. Opponents argued that the pill causes abortion, which they strongly oppose. Medical authorities disputed this. Conservatives feared its use would make young girls more promiscuous. Research following 2,000 California girls found that those who used the pill were not more likely to have unprotected sex.Introduction of the \"morning-after pill\" led to much controversy over its use and distribution. Some groups considered it a form of abortion while others argued it was not. Some said it encouraged teen-age sex while scientific studies indicated it did not. The pill was available by prescription only. Proponents argued for its sale \"over the counter\" (OTC). Opponents said this would encourage teen-age sex. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a proposal for OTC sales in May 2004. In January 2005 it continued to consider OTC sales to women 16 years or older.Debate continues on over-the-counter availability of the \"morning after pill.\" US supporters consider it safe and effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Those opposed, especially the Bush administration and the religious right, consider the pill an abortion, interference with \"natural law\", and promoting promiscuity. Two studies found it did not increase sexual activity, but also did not decrease pregnancies.

    "summary": "With rising prices of natural gas and oil, interest is increasing in alternative fuels. The market for solar power is expected by some to grow 35% a year in the next five years. Earlier, $20,000, the minimum cost to install a home solar-power system, was too high; but now higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utilities help reduce that cost. California has many solar electricity systems already in operation. Interest is widespread. Portugal plans the world's biggest solar energy power station. Taiwan claims the best silicon solar cell plant. Italy has Europe's first solar-powered train.Spain loaned the Philippines $4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households, schools, potable water systems, and health centers. Portugal planned to begin work on the world's biggest solar power station in 2006. The project, built by BP, was expected to create 240 jobs. The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy. Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning, illumination, and safety systems. Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power.Interest in solar power is increasing with large scale projects planned in Portugal and the Philippines. Large energy giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in producing equipment. The agricultural valleys of California are considered favorable for solar power. Home conversions to solar power will probably require subsidies to offset initial costs but will lead to low monthly bills. Improvements in semiconductors will aid solar development. Solar panels on trains in Italy and Japan provide for air conditioning, illumination and safety systems. Solar cars and backpacks have been developed.Expectations are high for the growth of solar power. Petroleum industry officials warn solar could become competitive by 2015. In the US, the solar market is expected to grow by 35% a year. In California, production increased from 10 megawatts in 2001 to 100 in 2005. In New York, demand for home systems skyrocketed this year. Portugal is planning a 62 megawatt power station for completion in 2009.

Denmark already receives 18% of its energy from wind power. Four hundred turbines are to be built in the sea off the coast of Spain. Fishermen claim they will disturb tuna migration and force their boats into treacherous waters. A U.S. plan to build 130 turbines in the ocean south of Cape Cod is meeting strong opposition from residents of nearby resorts who say the turbines would spoil the view, disrupt fishing and harm birds.The first US offshore wind turbine plan was in Nantucket Sound. Opponents of offshore wind power sought a more comprehensive strategy for wind energy and argued it would spoil vacation area aesthetics, disrupt commercial fishing and harm birds and marine life. One study found the proposal would have little effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life or fishing conditions. Another study concluded the turbines could alter local weather. Fishermen opposed clusters of windmills on Spain's southern shore because they would disturb tuna migration and necessitate dangerous detours.Proponents of wind turbine generated power consider it a safe, pollution free, way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It counteracts global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and preserves oil and natural gas resources. They contend there is no harm to the local environment and even attract sightseers. Opponents primarily consider wind farms to be a blight on the landscape that lowers property values, tourism and jobs.

On Feb. 3 Pakistan's Prime Minister opined that recent developments were Nepal's internal matters while Japan voiced concern and urged a return to democracy.The US faced a policy challenge resulting from the unexpected action of Nepal's King Gyanendra in dissolving the government and claiming absolute power. The king claimed it was necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of Maoist insurgency. The US, Britain and India who provide aid to Nepal have widely condemned the king's action. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern and the European Union joined the international condemnation of Gyanendra's action. Japan, another aid donor to Nepal, voiced concern at the power grab. China called the action \"an internal affair\" and Pakistan adopted the same approach.Nepali King Gyanendra's power grab added to the regional sense that Nepal is in a downward spiral. The US, UN, EU, India and Britain condemned the move as a setback for democracy. The US and India have made no decision on continuation of military aid they were providing to Nepal in its struggle against rebels. Top Nepali aid donor Japan urged peace through dialogue. India wants to minimize links between Nepal's and India's rebels. PM Singh canceled his attendance at a summit in Bangladesh, which was postponed in response. Pakistan and China remained neutral. Human rights groups condemned both sides.Most countries, including the U.S., Britain, India, and Japan, have condemned Nepali King Gyanendra's seizure of power. The U.S. has not yet decided whether to continue its military and development aid. India has not yet commented on its military aid but is expected to continue to support Nepal's fight against the Maoist rebels. Both the E.U. and the U.N. condemned the move and called for an immediate return to multi-party democracy. International organizations including Amnesty International have denounced the suspension of civil liberties. China alone remained neutral, maintaining that this was an \"internal matter.\"",

An appeal in April 2005 by Sinn Fein leader Adams to the IRA to abandon armed struggle was endorsed in May by Irish Prime Minister Ahern. All interested parties awaited a response from the IRA. In late June the U.S. State Department supported British Prime Minister Blair's and Ahern's call for a response. In late July there was a first glimmer of hope as three senior Sinn Fein leaders resigned from the ruling body of IRA's military wing.Irish PM Ahern said the main goal of the US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998, a joint Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland, could be revived only with a complete end of IRA weapons use. The landmark peace deal led to a virtual end of violence in that area. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has appealed to IRA members to end their armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will disarm. British PM Blair and Ahern will chair a review of the Northern Ireland situation in London.The US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 ended three decades of violence and created a power-sharing plan in Northern Ireland. It required a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality, and decommissioning of IRA weapons. Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following continued IRA underground activities. In 2005 Gerry Adams, leader of Catholic Sinn Fein, appealed to IRA members to give up violence in favor of democratic methods, followed by similar appeals by Irish PM Bertie Ahern and Protestant party leader Ian Paisley. Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris resigned from the IRA paramilitary council, severing its political and military wings.The 1998 Good Friday Peace accord had proposed a joint Catholic-Protestant administration, including the Sinn Fein, for Northern Ireland. Although ending decades of fighting, power sharing collapsed in 2002 because of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) - the military arm of the Sinn Fein - activities and failure to disarm. In 2005, British and Irish leaders sought to restore the power sharing institutions. Protestants insisted the IRA disband and disarm. Protestant leaders was urged to come onboard the peace process. On August 23, three Sinn Fein leaders resigned from leadership positions in the IRA, severing their military ties.",

The rebels themselves suspended talks in April 2003 when internecine struggles broke out between rebel groups. The government claims the Tigers are holding up negotiations and accuses them of killing over 250 of their political rivals since the truce of 2002 went into effect. The government released ten Tamil Tigers from jail on bail, and the rebels responded by freeing two homeguards who had been held hostage since August.Negotiations under the Norwegian-sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government of Sri Lanka were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within the LTTE. The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004. While LTTE sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations, Sri Lanka blamed LTTE for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003.A group from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with the Sri Lankan government. A cease in that country brokered by Norway has been observed since February 2002; however, internecine clashes between the LTTE and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between the government and the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by the LTTE. Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed. Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka to push for resumption of talks.Efforts to revive talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings. In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks, while the government said that it had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations. Japan's special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka on 27 October for a 7-day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks.

Iceland intervened, and Japan agreed not to deport Fischer if Iceland would give him citizenship. Iceland furnished him a special passport and residency permit. Japan insisted on full citizenship, which was finally granted. Iceland revered Fischer because it was there that he defeated Boris Spassky, the Russian chess champion, in 1972, during the cold war.Bobby Fischer, held in detention in Japan in March 2005 awaiting deportation to the U.S., could achieve asylum in Iceland if granted Icelandic citizenship. He was given residency status, but Iceland's parliament had rejected citizenship in February. Several Icelandic politicians indicated on March 16 that parliament was likely to grant citizenship.

Two cases from Texas and Kentucky raised several questions. Are the T.C. a religious statement, a part of legal history, or both? If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely.On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the display of the Ten Commandments on government property. In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June.A homeless man, Thomas Van Orden, in Texas is challenging the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and two stars of David on the Capitol grounds. A Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses. Opponents of the displays argue the displays violate the First Amendments prohibition on establishing an official state religion. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one. The Bush administration has argued on behalf of the displays. Questioning by justices during hearings suggests they are headed for a split decision.The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings. Justice O'Connor is expected to cast the swing votes.",

Thursday's attacks killed at least 19 and included a car bombing near Samarra and three blasts in Basra. Forty-five polling stations were attacked across Iraq on Friday. At least six were killed. Attacks occurred around Kirkuk, Baghdad, Al-Dur, Tikrit, and Shorgat. On Saturday, several polling stations were struck, but no large-scale insurgent offensive materialized. A suicide bomber of al-Zarqawi's al-Qaida network attacked a station in Khanaqin. Other attacks occurred in Baghdad, Ramadi, Kirkuk, Baiji, and Moqdadiya. At least 18 were killed on Saturday.Three days before Sunday's election, 40 polling stations were already destroyed. Most were empty and casualties were low. Polling station attacks escalated Thursday through Saturday but no large-scale offensive materialized. Violence was concentrated in the Sunni heartland. Polling stations were attacked with homemade bombs, car bombs, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire. Two police guards were shot dead. The worst attacks were a car bomb in Samarra that hit a nearby Iraqi army patrol, killing seven; and a Zarqawi-connected suicide bomber who approached a Khanaqin polling station and set off a blast that killed eight, including three soldiers.In the days leading up to the January 30, 2005 elections in Iraq, more than 100 of the more than 5,000 polling places across the nation were attacked, with many of those destroyed. Although 400 Iraqi were reportedly killed in January as part of the anti-election campaign, casualties at the polling places were limited because many were empty. The attacks ranged from car-suicide bombers, to small bombs, mortars and bullets, to posters and pamphlets. The threats to the polling places came from guerilla and militant groups, to include Al-Qaeda and mujahedeen factions. They promised more violence on election day.Despite heavy security measures, scores of attacks targeted Iraqi polling places throughout the country in the days preceding the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, with some 40 polling stations destroyed. Casualties, including Iraqi policemen, soldiers, a child, and a woman, were low because most of the buildings were not occupied. The attacks struck polling places in Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk, Al-Dur, Baiji, Shorgat, and Moqdadiya. Violence is expected to escalate on Sunday and continue after the elections. Many Sunnis are expected to boycott the elections, but a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds.",

New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days. On the morning of April 18, 2005, Cardinal Ratzinger, a prominent contender for pope, delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy. That afternoon, after the first voting session, a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof, which would indicate election of a pope, turned to black, showing that no decision had been made.On Sunday, April 17, 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents arrived at the Vatican to select a successor to Pope John Paul II. On Monday, they convened a conclave, a secret and sacred gathering, in the Sistine Chapel. Following the cardinals' oath, the selection process began. A two-thirds majority is required to elect a pope. Outside, attention was focused on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke of burning ballots that would indicate a successful election. Monday, black smoke rose from the chimney. The cardinals would return twice daily, beginning Tuesday, for additional ballots.The conclave was introduced to inconvenience cardinals and thus speed up the process. Today it helps preserve secrecy. The opening pageant is televised, then all news media and audiovisual or communication equipment is banned. Cardinals move into St. Martha's House and are forbidden to talk to anyone not sworn to secrecy. In 1996 John Paul II instituted new rules concerning choosing a pope. Until a two-thirds majority is reached the pattern is seven ballots and a day of rest. If a deadlock remains after 12 days, voting may resort to simple majority. Bells will ring when a pope is elected.On April 18, 2005, 115 cardinals, all under 80, were sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new pope. After a televised mass, they took an oath of secrecy, then moved to the Sistine Chapel, which had been swept for bugs and contained electronic jammers. They meet twice a day, voting twice each session, until one man receives a 2/3's majority. After each vote the ballots are burned - black smoke signals no one was elected. When a pope is chosen, white smoke will be accompanied by bells. Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square watched the first ballot's black smoke.",

    "summary": "Betty Friedan was a brilliant, visionary woman who came to prominence in 1963 with publication of her book, The Feminine Mystique. The wildly popular book brought about a re-examination of women's role in society. Friedan found that many women were not content with lives of domesticity, and she campaigned for greater access to work outside the home. She was the first president of the National Organization for Women and a leader in the drive to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She was abrasive, and some feminists criticized her for ignoring concerns of women of color, lesbians and the poor.In 1963 Betty Friedan wrote a provocative book, The Feminine Mystique, that ignited the feminist movement. The book exposed American women's discontent with domesticity and workplace discrimination. Friedan started an international movement. She founded and was elected president of NOW. She helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and a group that later became NARAL. For two decades she led demonstrations, protest marches, and news conferences. Her moderate belief that women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men caused a split with other feminist leaders and her relegation to the sidelines in the late 1970's.Betty Friedan's 1963 controversial bestseller \"The Feminine Mystique\" made her the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement. Her pioneering book identified the unhappiness of post-WWII American women unfulfilled by traditional domesticity. She was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and pushed for legal abortion. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was its first president, splitting with them over their emphasis on lesbian issues and alienating men. She led the 1970 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality. She was a founder of the Women's Political Caucus and NARAL. She wrote \"The Second Stage\" in 1981.Betty Friedan's 1963 classic \"The Feminine Mystique\" started a social revolution that led to the modern women's movement. It was included in Human Events magazine's list of the \"Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th centuries.\" Frieden helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1970, she led a 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality down Fifth Avenue.

He's suing XtraJet for videotaping his conversations with his lawyer. There's upheaval in his legal team since he fired two attorneys, hired one, and another took leave. Jackson's attorneys accused District Attorney Tom Sneddon of having a vendetta against him. Prosecutors alleged Jackson plotted to kidnap his accuser. In one week, Jackson was hit with two non-payment lawsuits. A rapper's video mocked Jackson and angered him, and he received a death threat. Investigators launched another search of Neverland Ranch, which frightened his children, and took a DNA sample.In November 2003 police arrested Michael Jackson on several counts of child molestation after having raided his California ranch.

    "summary": "The Bush administration began an offensive in 2005 to persuade Congress to renew the Patriot Act, parts of which would expire in 2006. That law, passed after September 11, gave broad powers to government agencies to obtain information for fighting terrorism. They argued the Patriot Act has prevented further attacks. A coalition of conservatives and liberals organized to demand changes, believing the Act endangered individual freedom. The groups challenged provisions giving access to library, medical and firearm-ownership records; allowing secret searches; and allowing surveillance of protests. Earlier, a judge disallowed forcing Internet providers to turn over records.The Patriot Act included major sections that expire in 2005 if not renewed by Congress. The Bush administration calls for complete renewal, but liberals and some conservatives maintain that the law gives the federal government too much power. Bush threatens to veto any congressional weakening of the Act. The specific sections are targeted by an unusual left-right coalition. The sections attacked are: the one permitting easy access to records in terrorism-related cases; the provision for \"sneak and peek\" secret searches before a warrant is presented; and an overbroad definition of \"terrorists\" that could include non-terrorist suspects.Weeks after 911 Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. The Act expanded Federal law enforcement officials' surveillance and prosecution power against suspected terrorists. Key elements of the Act were to expire at the end of 2005. Congress had to decide whether to renew them. The Bush administration argued that the Act had kept America safe and sought to retain all elements. Opponents argued that the Act undermined freedom and gave the federal government too much power. Groups opposed to the renewal of the Act formed a coalition, Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, to lobby Congress to repeal key provisions.President Bush, the outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft and his deputy, James Comfey, have promoted the Patriot Act. The President and incoming Attorney General Gonzales have called for it extension. Ashcroft's speeches promoting of the Act have not violated anti-lobbying rules. The liberal American Civil Liberties Union and conservative libertarian groups have joined forces to oppose giving government access to library and medical records. A US district judge ruled that a provision of the Patriot Act that enabled federal authorities to force Internet service providers to provide subscriber information violated the First and Fourth Amendments.",

The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games.Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple has been frustrated by IBMs failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat. After weeks of rumors, Jobs announced that the switch would be made by 2007. Apple must now persuade software developers to make their programs run on Intel chips. Apple's operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows. Intel's CEO said his company is thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer.Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple's annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors. Apple engineers have secretly worked on a transition for five years. Every edition of Macintosh OS X since then has been designed to run on both IBM and Intel chips. Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both chips.

Prosecutors are focusing less on Kozlowski's life of excess and more on how he allegedly looted the company.

He and another Tyco executive, Mark Swartz, are also accused in a larceny case of looting over $600M from the company by illegally awarding themselves bonuses and concealing them from shareholders. A trial of the two ended in a hung jury. They are to be retried in New York. The judge refused separate trials.The first unfocused, lengthy trial of Tyco executives Kozlowski and Swartz for stealing $600 million from Tyco was aborted after juror intimidation. The judge ruled a claim on behalf of Tyco was barred under Bermuda law, but allowed a class action lawsuit by Tyco shareholders. He refused to separate the two men's cases or allegations of accounting fraud and looting. In the retrial, prosecutors are concentrating on accusations that the men hid unauthorized bonuses, secretly forgave loans to themselves, and lied about Tyco's finances to inflate stock before selling it. The defense is trying to discredit the board of directors.",

    "summary": "One way to get rid of carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is to bury it. Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005.Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States, Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas. Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming.Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor, is not a new idea and is gaining support. In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground. Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe, reliable, and dependent on cost. The question arises if the process could cause an earthquake.Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996. Texas geologists are pumping compressed CO2 into a sandstone layer one mile beneath an old Louisiana-Texas oil field. CO2 from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is being pumped under a working Weyburn, Saskatchewan oilfield. Britain will pump CO2 from a Scottish power station to an old North Sea oil reservoir. The US backs carbon sequestration development and coal gasification technology that can sequester siphoned-off CO2, and plans to use carbon sequestration for mercury control.

    "summary": "After being caught, A.Q. Khan, Pakistan's revered father of its nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to black market dealings in nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned, but remains under house arrest. Recent investigations found evidence that Khan delivered bomb blueprints and weapons-grade enriched uranium to Iran. He sold warhead blueprints to Libya and possibly to North Korea. Evidence surfaced of his vast global enterprise, his facilities in Dubai and South Africa, and international connections from Asia to Africa. Pakistan's government expressed skepticism over recent claims and refuses to allow foreign authorities question Khan.Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales.A.Q. Khan sold nuclear bomb technology and material to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Possible motives were profit, ego, and a guarantee of Muslim influence. He traded centrifuge technology to China for bomb design. Pakistan claims to cooperate with the international community and put Khan under house arrest but won't let him be questioned. President Musharraf pardoned Khan, let him keep his profits, and denied government involvement. The US, not wanting to alienate ally Pakistan, quarreled with the IAEA and is investigating separately. Khan chief lieutenant Tahir is in jail. Khan's network operated in over 30 countries, including South Africa.A.Q. Khan headed an illicit, global, network, providing nuclear information and material to at least Libya, Iran, and North Korea. He visited other potential customers and uranium suppliers. He appears motivated by hatred of India, monetary gain, egotism, and pan-Muslim and anti-Western goals. The US had tracked him for years and pressured his confession to nuclear proliferation in 2004, but could not be too forceful because of Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror. The Pakistani government placed Khan under house arrest, but pardoned him because he is a national hero. It denied any official knowledge of his activities.",

    "summary": "Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk increases with the age of the father. Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects.There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia, but no complete theory. Children born of older fathers are at higher risk. No schizophrenia-causing gene has been identified, but a few victims display a gene-mutation associated with Rett syndrome. Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk, but the risk decreases with age. Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims. Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person's genome.Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and their fathers' age, demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age. Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain. A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana (also known as cannabis) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia. A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia's nongenetic aspects.The older the father, the greater children's risk of developing schizophrenia. Heavy marijuana use over years increases schizophrenia risk. Impaired thought processes in schizophrenics have been linked to a thinning outer layer of brain grey matter. The epigenome and a mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene each may be involved in schizophrenia. A detailed model of the brain's circuitry being developed in Switzerland, might help show why malfunctions that cause schizophrenia occur. DNA biopsy may allow testing for schizophrenia in utero and finding damaged genes in schizophrenics. A search of Iceland's comprehensive records failed to find a schizophrenia-causing gene.",

Minutes after the announcement political leaders and lobby groups prepared for the ensuing battle. Liberals did not want an \"extremist\" and Republicans wanted a judge who would apply rather than interpret the Constitution. President Bush's choice of a judge was important because of key cases in abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights. One of the difficulties in nominating a judge is that they do not always vote the way one would assume, given their political affiliation or ideology.Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the US Supreme Court, is retiring. She gave no reason but a Court spokesman indicated her need to spend more time with her husband who has Alzheimer's. O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Court was considered a conservative when seated but became more moderate over the years. President Reagan appointed her in 1981. President Bush now has his first opportunity to nominate someone to the high court and promises to do so in a timely manner. Liberals warned against picking an \"extremist\" while Republicans argued for a strict conservative.Sandra O'Connor, 75, appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan in 1981 and first woman on the court, announced her retirement, effective on confirmation of her successor. She will spend time with her Alzheimer's-patient husband. Bush promised to be deliberate, thorough, and timely in choosing a successor; to have no litmus test on abortion or gay marriage; and to pick a strict constitutionist who will not legislate from the bench. This first vacancy in 11 years gives Bush the chance to shape court ideological balance. O'Connor was a frequent swing vote. Bush chastised critics of Alberto Gonzales as a candidate.July 1, 2005 Supreme Court Justice O'Connor resigned, effective with the confirmation of her successor. One of only two female justices, she gave no reason. She is 75, has served 24 years, and her husband has Alzheimer's disease. President Bush began a \"deliberate and thorough\" hunt for a replacement. Liberals warned him to avoid an extremist, while conservatives urged him to pick a strict constructionist. Four male federal judges and the Attorney General were mentioned. Abortion is a key question.

Huygens would spend three weeks descending toward Titan, shooting pictures for 2-1/2 hours before hitting the surface. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has an atmosphere. During the seven years mothership Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached Huygens probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.After a seven-year journey, the Huygens space probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24, beginning its three-week, 2 million-mile free fall toward Saturn's moon Titan. It will remain dormant until January 14, when it will float to the moon's surface on parachutes, shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface. Scientists hope Huygens will confirm the assumption that Titan's atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth.

It would undermine stabililty across the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan's President Chen. Taiwan sent six delegations to the U.S., Japan and EU countries the year before to brief officials on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations the law would have. Beijing said in March, that \"one country, two systems\" was its basic approach to Taiwan, outlining, for the first time, its anti-secession law that was being considered by the National People's Congress.Planned consideration of an Anti-secession Law (ASL) by China's National People's Congress (NPC) stirred strong reactions in Taiwan. Taiwanese see the bill as establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan. Furthermore, the ASC would diminish cross-Taiwan strait travel and restrict free expression of ideas, hindering cross-strait rapprochement. Taiwan claimed the support of the United States and European Union in opposing the measure. On March 8, 2005 as the NPC began deliberations on the bill, spokesmen defended the ASL as a means of promoting China's peaceful reunification on the basis of \"one country, two systems.\"The PRC claims the anti-secession law to be deliberated by its legislative body in March is aimed at promoting a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. It denies that it would be used to justify military action. The PRC maintains that the one country, two systems approach is best for Taiwan. Taiwan fears the anti-secession law is designed to legalize a Beijing military invasion. It says it is a provocation that would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. Its ruling and opposition parties agreed to adopt a resolution against the Beijing law. The US and EU support Taiwan's position.Taiwan considers the PRC's plan to enact an anti-secession law a provocative move to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Emphasizing that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC as Beijing claims, Taiwan believes the legislation is aimed at establishing a legal justification for Beijing's invasion of the island. The U.S. and E.U.consider the legislation counterproductive to peace. The PRC claims that the law is designed to check the secessionist activities of \"Taiwan independence\" forces and promote China's reunification. The PRC legislature is scheduled to take up the anti-secession law in March.",

    "summary": "Two men accused of bombing an Air India jet, killing 329 people in 1985, were tried in Vancouver nearly 20 years later. Prosecutors charged that a millionaire named Malik and a millworker named Bagri were Sikhs taking revenge against the Indian government, which owned Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The prosecution's case rested upon their providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with investigations, and admissions to people they trusted. Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses. There were years of bungled police work and unexplained killings of witnesses.Two Sikhs, Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri, were charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 passengers and with killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport. Final arguments in their murder trial concluded in December 2004. Prosecutors believe the Sikhs' motive was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The trial was not settled due to years of bungled police work, unexpected killings of witnesses and a suspect, and vague and contradictory testimonies. Justice Ian Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will deliver his decision in March 2005.Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri have been in custody over four years accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet in June 1985 killing 329 people. Prosecutors believe the two British Columbia-based Sikh extremists acted in revenge against the Indian government for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The trial is being held in a bomb-proof court built especially for this trial, the largest and most complex in Canadian history. More than 100 witnesses have testified. Some key witnesses have offered vague and contradictory recollections. Two potential witnesses were assassinated and others received threats. Key evidence is circumstantial.Final arguments were presented in the British Columbian trial of two Indian Sikh immigrants accused of involvement in two bombings: an Air India jet which exploded off the Irish coast in 1985, killing all 329 aboard; and a bomb that killed two baggage handlers in Tokyo. The prosecution held that the men wanted revenge against the Indian government for attacking Sikhdom's most holy temple in 1984. The defense argued against the credibility of three key witnesses. There is no physical evidence or first-hand testimony linking the suspects to the bombings. The judge will deliver a decision on 16 March.",

    "summary": "Roper vs. Simmons presented the Supreme Court a chance to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by 16-17-year-olds. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be \"swing votes.\" In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that \"world opinion is against us\" in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18.On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal.The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states.In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles. Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged.",
